nambUtiri-paternal-uncle-shrAddha In Shankarasmriti, the code of law which became popular in Kerala with rise of Namboothiri tradition, It is stated that the eldest son in a family must perform Pitr Karma for all his paternal uncles as well.
It is since younger brothers of father mostly married into matrilineal castes like Kshatriya-Nairs and Ambalavasis, and they did not have any heir to perform Pitra Karma for them becuase children in these unions belonged to mother&amp;rsquo;s family and they performed Pitr Karma to their maternal uncles or karnavars instead of their fathers.</description>
