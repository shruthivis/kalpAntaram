CHAPTER III PRĀYAŚCITTA; ITS ORIGIN, DERIVATION
AND MEANING
It is now necessary to turn to prāyaścittas as removers of sin. A number of subjects will fall to be treated here,
First, an attempt must be made to understand the etymo logy and meaning of the word &amp;lsquo;prāyascitta&amp;rsquo; in ancient times. There are two forms of the word, prāyaścitti and prāyaścitta, which occur in Vedic works without distinction of meaning and both forms are fairly old, though prāyaścitti appears to be the older of the two.</description>

CONSEQUENCES OF NOT UNDERGOING PENANCES
CHAPTER VI
CONSEQUENCES OF NOT UNDERGOING PENANCES
If a sinner did not undergo a prāyaścitta, the Smộtis, Purānas, medieval digests declared that he had to suffer dire and far-reaching consequences. Yāj. III. 221 declares that men addicted to sins, who feel no repentance and who (therefore ) do not undergo the proper penances, fall into painful and horri ble hells.
