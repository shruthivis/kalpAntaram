Gautama ( II. 1) says that before upanayapa, a boy may act, speak and eat as and what he likes (i. e. may follow his inclinations). Haradatta explains that this does not mean that he can kill a brāhmana or drink liquor, but that there is no restriction, although he be a brāhmana&rsquo;s son, to his selling what is forbidden to a brābmana to sell, or he may eat onions and garlic or stale food or may eat four or five times a day." />

  <p>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p>SAMSKĀRAS</p>
<p>Gautama ( II. 1) says that before upanayapa, a boy may act, speak and eat as and what he likes (i. e. may follow his inclinations). Haradatta explains that this does not mean that he can kill a brāhmana or drink liquor, but that there is no restriction, although he be a brāhmana&rsquo;s son, to his selling what is forbidden to a brābmana to sell, or he may eat onions and garlic or stale food or may eat four or five times a day. Ap. Dh. S. +38 (II. 1. 6. 15. 17-20 ) states several views on this point. &lsquo;Up to the time when they begin to take cooked food infants do not become impure ( by the touch of a rajasvala &amp;o. ); according to some ( teachers ) up till they are one year old ; or till they are not able to distinguish the cardinal points; another view is that till upanayang ( they do not become impure ). Aparārka (p. 28 ) also explains that a boy may ( before upa nayana) eat the leavings of the food of his parents, but he cannot eat or drink what would cause loss of caste as in that case he may become unfit to have the samskāra of upanayana performed on him. The Sinrtyarthasāra gives the view of some that in case an infant touches &amp; cāṇḍāla before it reaches the age of taking cooked food, only water need be sprinkled on it, before caula ācamana need be done by it and after caula (and before upanayana ) a bath would be necessary. Vas. Dh. 8. (II. 6 ) quotes &amp; verge of Harita to the effect &lsquo;up till investi ture with the girdle of muõja grass ( i. e. till upanayana ) there is no action that is obligatory on him, as long as he is not born again for Vedic study he may be in his conduot like &amp; sūdra *438, This verse occurs also in Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 6 and Manu II. 171 and 172. Daksa I. 3-4 gays Till a boy is eight years old he is like one newly born and only indicates the caste in which he is born.

As to prāya soitta when a child is guilty of the commission of a mah.. pātaka, sea under prāyaścitta later on and the Mit on Yāj. III. 253. The sinṭtis look upon upanayang as the second birth of a boy (the first being his physical birth ) &ldquo;1. Gaut. (X. 1 and 51 ) says that the three higher classes are called dvijātis ( having two births ), while the sūdra is only ekajāli. +48 Ap. Dh. S, says (1. 1. 1. 16-18 ), the teacher causes him ( the boy who is initiated into Vedic study ) to be born from vidyā (i.e. by imparting Vedic knowledge ), that birth is superior, the parents produce only the body s43. Upanayana is like Baptism and St. John (3. 3 ) also says&rsquo; except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.&rsquo; Manu II. 147-148 ( = Viṣṇu Dh, S. 30. 45-46 ) convey the same idea. Manu ( II. 169 ) speaks of three births in the case of a man, first birth from his mother, the second when the girdle is tied (i, e, on upana yana ) and the third when he is initiated for &amp; Vedic sacrifice. Upanayana is the foremost of the samskārasAtri (141-142 ) says &lsquo;a person is known as a brābmaṇa by birth, he is said to be a dvija ( twice-born) on account of samskāras, he reaches the position of a vipra by learning ( study of the Veda ); he is called śrotriya on account of all these three&rsquo;, 144 Parāśara (VIII. 19) contains a fine image to illustrate this just as a work of painting gradually unfolds itself on account of the several colours (with which it is drawn), so brahmanya (the status of a brāhmaṇa) is similarly</p>

<p>brought out by samskāras performed according to prescribed</p>
<p>rites.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Therefore it is now time to speak of samskāras.</p>
<p>The word samskāra hardly ever occurs in the ancient Vedic literature, but the root “kf&rsquo; with &lsquo;sam&rsquo; and the past passive participle &lsquo;samsksta&rsquo; occur often enough. In Rg. V. 76.2 the word samsksta is applied to &lsquo;gharma&rsquo; (vessel) <em>the two Asvins do not harm the gharma that has been purified.&rsquo; In Rg. VI. 28. 4 we have the word sanskrtatra&rsquo; and Rg. VIII. 33. 9 hasranāya samskrtah&rsquo;. Sat,</em>** Br. I. 1. 4. 10 speaks of preparing (or purifying) offering (havis ) for the gods. So in Sat. Br. III. 2. 1. 2% therefore a woman approaches a man who stands in &amp; well-trimmed (samskýta ) house.&rsquo; Vide Vāj. S. IV. 34 for a similar use of samaksta. In Chan. Up. IV. 16. 2, we 448 read &ldquo;of that sacrifice there are two ways, by mind, by speech; the Brahmā (priest) prepares (or polishes ) one of them by his mind.&rdquo; The word samskāra is used several times in the sutras of Jaimini ( as in III. 1. 3, III. 2. 15 and 17, III. 8. 3, IX, %, 9, 42, 44, IX, 3.25, IX. 4. 33, IX. 4. 50 and 54, X, 1.2 and 11 &amp;c.). It generally means some purificatory aot in a sacrifice e. g. in Jaimini III. 8. 3 the word is applied to the actions of shaving the head, washing the teeth and paring the nails on the part of the sacrificer in Jyotiṣtoma; in IX. 3, 25 the word samskāra is applied to prokṣaṇa ( sprinkling with water), in X. 2. 49 it is applied to the sharing of the head and face. In Jaimini *** VI. 1.35 the word samskāra stands for upanayana. Sabara explains 448 samskāra as that which being effected makes &amp; certain thing or person fit for a certain purpose and the Tantra vārtika says that samskāras are those actions and rites that</p>

<p>impart fitness and it further says 449 &ldquo;fitness is of two kinds; it arises by the removal of taints (sins) or by the generation of fresh qualities. Samskāras generate fresh qualities, while tapas brings about the removal of taints. He who performs such sacrifices as Jyotiṣtoma and others has certain blemishes in him due to not doing in this life or a previous life duties laid down for him or doing what is forbidden. If they (blemishes) are not removed they obstruct the ( acquisition of the) reward of the sacrifice even if it be entirely free from any defects whatever, as they (blemishes ) produce (for the sacrificer) the experience of their own fruits that are opposed to the (fruit of the ) sacrifice.&rsquo; The Viramitrodaya 450 (on sarskāra ) defines *saṁskāra&rsquo; as &lsquo;&amp; peculiar excellence due to the performance of rites ordained (by the śāstra ) which resides either in the Boul or the body and says that it is of two kinds, one kind making a person eligible for performing other actions (e. g. upanayana renders &amp; person eligible for Vedic study), while another kind removes the evil taint that may have been gene rated (e. g. Jatakarma removes the taint due to seed and uterus). The word saṛskāra does not ocour in most of the grhyasūtras ( it ocours in Vaik. ), but it ocoura in the Dharmasūtras (vide Gaut. VIII. 8, Ap. Dh. I. 1. 1. 9, Vas. IV. 1).</p>
<p>The principal matters that fall to be discussed under ganskaras are: the purpose of sarskāras, the classification of Bamskāras, the number of samskāras, the procedure of each of the saṁskāras and the persons authorized to perform them and the persons for whom they are to be performed.</p>
<p>First as to the purpose of saṇskāras. Mann ( II. 27-28 ) says &lsquo;In the case of dvijātis, the taints (or sins ) due to seed and the uterus (1. e. derived from parents ) are wiped off by the homas ( burnt oblations) performed during pregnancy and by jātakarma ( ceremonies on birth), caula ( tonsure ) and the tying of the girdle of muñja grass. This (human) body is rendered fit for the attainment of brahma by the study of the Veda, by ( observance of) vratas, homas ( oblations in fire ), by the vrata called traividya, by worship (of gods, sages and manos), by generation of sons, by the performance of the five daily</p>

<p>saorifices and by (solemn Vedic ) sacrifices. The view of Yaj. (I, 13 ) is that &rsquo;thus (i.e. by the performance of samskāras ) the taint arising from the seed and uterus (i. e. from the physioal defects of parents ) is removed.&rsquo; These words of Manu and Yāj. are variously interpreted by the commentators. Medhātithi says &lsquo;sead and uterus are not the causes of sin and therefore all that is meant by enas ( in Manu II. 27 ) is impurity.&rsquo; Kullūka explains that blemishes of seed are those arising from intercourse in a prohibited manner and the *garbhika&rsquo; blemish is what arises from huving to stay in the womb of an impure mother. The Mit. 451 on Yāj. I. 13 makes it clear that samskāras are deemed to remove bodily defects trans mitted from parents (euch as defective limbs, diseases &amp;c. ) and are not intended to remove the taint of being born of sinful parents. Manu II. 66 also states that all the samskāras are performed on a woman also for the purification of the body. Hārsta $8 as quoted in the Samskāratattva says when a person has intercourse according to the procedure of garbhādhāna he establishes in the wife a foetus that becomes fit for the reception of the Veda, by the rite of punsavana he makes the garbha become &amp; male, by the ceremony of Simantounayana he removes from the foetus the taint derived from the parents and the accumu lated taints ( which are five ) due to seed, blood and womb are removed by jātakarma, nāmakarana, annaprāśana, cūdākarana and samāvartana. By these eight sam,kāras (from garbha. dhāna) purity arises.&rsquo; The exact significance of samskāras in the development of bigher human personality was left rather vague in our authorities and their treatment of the purpose of samskāras is not very elaborate or exhaustive. The samskaras had been treated from very ancient times as necessary for unfolding the latent capacities of man for development and as being the outward symbols or signs of the inner change whioh would fit human beings for corporate life and they also tended to confer &amp; certain status on those who underwent them. If we look at the list of sarskāras we shall find that the purposes</p>

<p>Saṁskāras</p>

<p>of samskāras were manifold. Some like Upanayang served spiritual and cultural purposes, they brought the unredeemed person into the company of the elect, they opened the door to Vedic study and thus conferred special privileges and exacted duties. They have also psychological values impressing on the mind of the person that he has assumed a new role and must strive to observe its rules. Other samskāras like namakarapa, annapraśana, and niskramana were more or less of a popular nature. They afforded opportunities for the expression of love and affection and for festivities. Other samskāras like garbhādhāna, pursevana, simantonnayana had also mystical and symbolical elements. Vivāha (marriage) was a sacrament which brought about a union of two personalities into one for the purpose of the continuance of society and for the uplift of the two by self-restraint, by self-sacrifice and mutual co-operation.</p>
<p>The samskāras were divided by Hārlta into two kinds, brahma and daiva. *$3 The saraskāras of garbhadhana and others which are described only in the smṛtis are called brābma and the man who is purified by performing them attains equality with sages, stays in the same world with them and is joined with them; pakayajñas ( offerings of cooked food ), yajñas with burnt offerings and sacrifoes in which soma is offered are called daiva (samskāras ). The last two varieties, viz. those in which there is burnt offering and those in wbich Boma is offered, are dealt with in the frauta sūtras, which have been left outside the purview of this work (except in the note at the end of this volume).</p>
<p>There is a great divergence of views among the writers on smrtis as to the number of samskāras. Gaut. ( VIII. 14-24) speaks of forty samskāras and eight virtues of the soul. The forty samskāras ars: garbhādhāna, pumaavana, sīmantonnayana; jātakarma, nāmakarana, annapraśana, caula, upanayana (8 in all ), the four vratas of the Veda, snana (or gamāvartana ), vivāha, five daily mahāyajñas (for deva, pits, manusya,</p>

<p>bhūta and brahma); seven pakayajñas *** (viz. aṣtaka, pārvapasthāllpaka, śrāddha, srāvapl, agrahāyani, caitri, aśva yuji); seven haviryajñas (in which there is burnt offering but no soma ) viz. Agnyādbeya, Agnihotra, Darśapūrṇamāsa, Agrayana, Caturmasyas, Nirudhapaśubandha and Sautrāmapi); seven soma sacrifices (Agniṣtoma, Atyagniṣtoma, Uktbya, Ṣodasin, Vājapeya, &lsquo;Atirātra, Āptoryāma). Gautama uses the word samskāra in the most extended sense. Saṅkba as quoted by the Sm. C. (I. p. 13) and the Subodhini on Mit. II. 4 follow Gautama. Vaik. speaks of eighteen sārira samskāras (in which he includes utthina, pravāsāgamana, piṇdavardhana, which are seen nowhere else as saṇskāras) and twenty-two yajñas (i. e. five daily yajā as as one and seven pākayajñas, seven havir-yajñas, and seven Boma yajñas). Most grhyasūtrag, dharmasūtras and smstis do not enumerate so many. Angiras ( quoted in the Samskāra mayūkba, Samskāra-prakāśa p. 135 and other digests) mentions twenty-five samskārag. They inolude all sarskāras of Gautama from garbhādhana to the five daily yajñas ( which latter are reckoned as one saṁskāra by Angiras ) and after nāmakarana niskramana is added. Besides, Viṣṇubali, Agrayana, Aṣtakā, Srāvapl, Aśvayuji, Mārgasirṣi ( same as Agrahāyaṇi), Pārvana, Utsarga and Upākarms are enumerated as the remaining samskāras by Angiras. Veda-Vyāsa . 14-15 enumerates sixteen samskāras. Manu, Yaj., Viṣṇu Dh. S, do not give the number of samskāras but simply say that they are those from niṣeka (garbhādhana) to smagāna (i. e. antyesti). This last one is not treated of in Gautama and several grh yasūtras. In most of the digests the principal samskāras are said to be sixteen; but there is some difference of opinion even as to these sixteen, 455 For example, Jātūkarnya as quoted in Sam. Pr. (p. 135 ) enumerates the 16 as garbhādhāna, pumsavana, simanta, jātakarma, nāmakaraṇa, annasrāśana, caula, mauñji</p>

<p>The grhyasūtras deal with Samskāras in two different sequences. Many of them begin with vivāha ( marriage ) and then proceed up to samāvartana. Some like the Hiranya kesigrhya, Bhāradyājagṣhya and Mānavagļhya begin with upanayana. 458 Some saṇskāras like Karnavedha and Vidya rambha are conspicuous by their absence in the grbyasūtras, but are added by later smstis and purāṇas. The following is the list of all the samskāras usually so called in most of the smrti works together with a few remarks against each as to the work or works in whioh each is mentioned or described. The samskāras are arranged in the sequence of the times at which in &amp; man&rsquo;s life they are performed beginning from garbhādhāna:</p>

In the Saṅkhim yana gļhya (I. 18-19), Pār. gr. I. 11, and Ap. 85. (8. 10-11) the rite called caturthikarma or caturthiboma takes the place of the rite oalled garbhādhāna elsewhere and there is no separate description of garbhādhāna in these and some similar</p>

This work however gives hardly any references to original Sanskrit authorities, is permeated by the spirit of a Christian missionary and commits the mistake, usual with most Western writers, of comparing hoary Indian customs, usages and the position of women with those of the West only in the latter half of the:19th century, alton gother ignoring what existod in Europe over a few bundred years ago, though it is generally written with sympatby and understanding.

<p>Pursavana :-occurs in almost all the gļhyasātras, in Gaut., in Yāj. (1. 11).</p>
<p>Garbharakṣana mentioned in the śānkhāyana gr. ( 1. 21). It seems to be the same as the Anavalobhang which according to the Aśvalāyana gr.(I, 13.1) occurs in the Upaniṣad and which is described in Aśv. gr. (1. 13, 5-7).</p>
<p>Simantonnayana :-This occurs almost everywhere. Yāj. I. 11 uses the word simanta.</p>

<p>Niṣkramana or Upaniṣkramana or Adityadarśana or Nirna. yana:-Yaj. I. 11 speaks of it as Niskramana, Pār. gr. (I 17 ) as Niskramanika, Manu IL. 34 speaks of it as Niṣkramaṇa. The Kausikastra 58. 18 calls it Nirṇayana; while Baud. gr. (II. 2) employs the word upaniṣkramaṇa; Mānava gr. (1. 19, 1), Viṣṇu Dh. S.

Gaut., Ap. gr. V. 12-13, Hir. gr. I. 9. 1, Yāj. L. 51, Pār. gr. ( II. 6-7) employ the word snāna for both the ceremo nial bath and the rites of return from the teacher&rsquo;s house on finishing one&rsquo;s studies, while Asv. gr. (III. 8. 1), Baud. g?.

<p>It is laid down that the sarskāras from jātakarma to gūdakarma were to be performed in the case of the twice-born classes with Vedic mantras when the child was a male and that in the case of girls the ceremonies were to be performed but without Vedic mantras ; vide Asy, gs. (I. 15. 12, 1. 16. 6, I. 17.18), Manu II. 66, Yaj I. 13. But marriage in the case of the girls of the three higher classes was to be performed with Vedic mantras ( Manu II, 67. Yaj. I. 13).</p>
<p>The samskāras 458 from garbhadhāna to upenayana alone were absolutely necessary in the case of all twice-born persons ;</p>

<p>the samskaras of snana and vivaha were not obligatory, as &amp; men was allowed to become a samnyāsin ( ascetio) immediately after finishing the period of studenthood (according to the Jabalo paniṣad ). The Samskāraprakasa enters upon an elaborate discussion as to whether jātakarma could be performed for a child that is neither &amp; male nor a female (pp. 195-197) and arrives at the conclusion that jātakarma and other samskaras cannot be performed for a kliba ( impotent) child.</p>
<p>Another question was as to what samskāras could be per formed for the sūdra. The view of Vedavyāgs that he could have ten samskāras performed (but without Vedic mantras ) has been stated above (p. 159 ). The Baijavāpa *s9 gļhya says that seven samskāras are allowed to the sūdra viz. froun garbhādhāna (or niṣeka ) to caula. The view of Aparārka 160 appears to be that the eight saröskāras from garbhādhāna to caula (in Yāj. 1.11-12) were meant for all varṇas (including the sūdra). According to the Madanaratna, Rūpanārāyaṇa and the bhāṣya of Harihara as quoted in the Nirnayasindhu, the sūdras were entitled to perform six saṛskāras viz. jatakarma, nāmakarana, niṣkra maṇa, annaprāśana, cūdā and vivaha and the five daily mahā. yajñas. The Sūdrakrtya-tattva of Raghunandana (p. 634 ) quotes &amp; verse from the Varāhapurāṇa 461 this very procedure (about sraddha ) has been declared in the case of sūdras but without mantras; for the sūdra who is not entitled to repeat a mantra, a brāhmaṇa repeats the mantra&rsquo; and then remarks that for a sūdra a mantra from the purāṇas is to be repeated by the brāhmaṇa priest employed, that the sūdra is not to repeat even the purāṇa mantras but has only to say &ldquo;namaḥ&rsquo;. The Nirnayasindhu 462 mentions with approval the same view of Śūlapāṇi that in all religious ceremonies for sūdras the man. tras are to be takon from the purāpas and that they are to be repeated by the brāhmana priest.

<p>in the Sm, O.( I. p. 24 ) and other digests states that no other sarskāra than vivāba is allowed to the sūdrs. On this the Nirpayasindhu remarks that these conflicting views are to be reconoiled by holding that the liberal ones apply to good (sat) sūdras and the stricter ones to low ( ayat) sūdras or that the rules are different in different countries.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that in modern times most of the samg. kāras (except garbbadhana, upanayana and vivāha) have fallen into oblivion and are bardly ever performed even by brāhmaṇas in the manner and at the times prescribed by the smrtis. Owing to the rapid rise in the marriageable age of brābmana girls, even the samskāra of garbhādhāna is falling into abeyance. Nāmakarana, annaprāśana are performed in a popular way but without Vedic mantras or without calling &amp; priest to officiate. In most cases caula is performed on the day of the upanayans and samāvartana is also performed a few days after upanayana. Jātakarms and annaprābana are performed on the same day in some parts (e. g. in Bengal). It appears that this state of things has continued for centuries. The Smṛtyarthasāra ** (p. 3) says &lsquo;if the samskāras (except upa nayana ) are not performed at the prescribed times, the Vyāhrti homa should be offered and then the samskāras should be per formed (though late ). For each samskāra that is not performed the penance called pādakṣcchra should be performed (if the non performance is due to some difficulty or distress ), and for non performance of caula the penance is ardha-kpoobra. If the sams kāras were knowingly omitted or if there was no distress then the penance is double &ldquo;$ of this.&rsquo; The Nirnayasindhu quotes verses of Saunaka *68 to this effect and then remarks that there was a conflict of views, some holding that after the penance the samskāras passed over should be performed all at one time,</p>

<p>while others held that they should not be performed at all after undergoing penance and a third view was that if caula was left unperformed it may be performed on the same day as upanayana. The Dharmasindhu (3rd pariccheda, purvārdha) states various substitutes (which are comparatively easy ) for these penances. For example, one prājāpatya penanoe is equal to three Pādaksochras. In place of prājāpatya the person guilty of the lapse may make the gift of a cow or (in the absence of a cow ) may give one niṣka (320 guñjās) of gold or one half or one-fourth of it; one who is very poor may give one-eighth of &amp; silver niṣka or corn of that value. There being these easy substitutes (pratyāmnāya as they were called ) people gradually left off performing the several samskāras and concentrated themselves only on upanayana and vivāha. The whole life of a person was 80 very minutely worked out and overlaid with so much ritual in the grhyasātras and smrtis that the tendency to neglect and change became insistent and inevitable. This tendency was helped by the accommodating spirit of the brāhmana authors of later smitis and digests that were ready to prescribe easier and easier substitutes for non-observance of the elaborate Sacraments, pre-natal and post-natal. Haradatta in commenting on Gaut. I. 6 ( upanayanam brāhmaṇasya aṣtame ) remarks the teacher (Gautama ) expounding upanayana first and passing over the samskāras like garbhadhāns that precede upanayana in time conveys that upanayana is the principal samskāra. Therefore even if the samskāras like garbhādbāna did not take place owing to adverseness of fate, upanayana can be performed, but it follows that if upanayana be not performed there is no adhikūra ( eligibility ) for marriage which follows only after upanayana.&rsquo; 467 In modern times in undergoing prayascitta for non-performance of the samskāras up to caula rupees two have to be paid to the priest (annas four for each of the samskāras not performed up to caula and annas eight for caula ).468</p>

The method followed will be as follows.

Only important parts of procedure can be noted, minute divergences among the several works being passed over.

<p>Garbhadhāna:&ndash;The beginnings of this ceremony are found very early. Atharvaveda V. 25 appears to be a hymn intended for the garbhādhāna rite. Atharva V. 25. 3 and 5 are verses whiob ocour in the Bṛ. Up. VI. 4. 21; the passage of the Br. Up. VI. 4. 13, 19&ndash;22 may be rendered thus : &lsquo;At the end of three days ( after menstruation first appears ) when she ( wife ) has bathed, the husband should make her pound rice ( whioh is then boiled and eaten with various other things according as he desires a fair, brown or dark son or a learned son or &amp; learned daughter )&hellip; and then towards morning, after having according to the rule of the Sthallpaka performed the preparation of the clarified butter, he sacrifices from the Sthalipaka little by little,</p>

(I. 11, S. B. E. vol. 29, pp. 288-290 ) also has a similar procedure. Ap. gr. (8. 10-11, S. B. E. vol. 30, Pp. 267-268 ), Gobbila II. 5 (8. B.

To modern minds it appears strange that intercourse should have been surrounded by so much of mysticism and religion in the ancient sutras. But in ancient times every act was sought to be invested with a religious halo; so much so that socording to Hir. gr. I. 7. 25.3. (S.B. E. vol. 30, p. 200) Atreya held that mantras were to be repeated at each cohabitation throughout life, while Bādarayana prescribed that this was necessary only at the first cohabitation and after each monthly course.478 The Hir. gs.

<p>caturthikarma is treated by the gļhya writers as part of the marriage rites and the rite was performed irrespective of the question whether it was the first appearance of menses or whether the wife had just before the marriage come out of her monthly illness. This indicates that it was taken for granted that the wife had generally attained the age of puberty at the time of marriage. As the marriageable age of girls oame down it appears that the rite of caturthikarma was discontinued and the rite was performed long after the ritual of marriage and appropriately named garbhādhāna.</p>
<p>The smrtis and nibandhas add many details some of which will have to be noticed. Manu (III. 46 ) and Yāj. I. 79 say that the natural period (for conception ) is sixteen nights from the appearance of menses, Ap. gļ. 9. 1 says 478 that each of the even nights from the 4th to 16th ( after the beginning of the monthly illness ) are more and more suited for excellence of (male) offspring. Hārlta also says the same. These two appear to allow garbhidhāna on the fourth night, but Manu (III. 47 ), Yāj. ( I. 79 ) lay down that the first four nights must be omitted. Katyayana, Parāśara (VII. 17) and others say that a woman in her menses is purified by bathing on the 4th day. Laghu-Āśvalāyana (III. 1) says that the garbhādhāna ceremony should be performed on the first appearance of menges after the 4th day has elapsed. The Sm. C. suggests that the 4th may be allowed if there is entire cessation of the flow, 474 Manu (IV, 128 ) and Yāj. I. 79 added further restrictions viz. that new moon and full moon days and the 8th and 14th tithis of the month were also to be omitted. Astrological details were added by Yāj 80 ( that the Mūla and Maghā constellations must be avoided and the moon must be auspiciously placed) and other later smrtis, which it is unnecessary to dwell upon. In the later smrtis like Laghu-Asvalāyana III. 14-19 and in nibandhas like the Nirṇayasindhu and Dharmasindhu elaborate discussions are held about the months, tithis, week</p>

<p>days, nakṣatras, colour of clothes, that were deemed to be inauspicious for the first appearance of menges and about the sāntis (propitiatory rites) for averting their evil effects. Ap. gr., Manu (III. 48), Yaj. (I. 79), Vaik. III, 9 hold that a man desirous of male issue should cohabit on the even days from the 4th day after the appearance of menges and if he cohabits on uneven days &amp; female child is born. Hir. gr. *75 1. 7. 24.8 (8. B. E. vol. 30 p. 199 ) and Bhāradvaja gr. (I. 20 ) prescribe that a woman in her menses who takes a bath on the 4th day should attire herself in white ( or pure ) clothes, should ornament herself and talk with (worthy ) brāhmaṇas (only ). The Vaik. (III. 9) further adds that she should anoint herself with unguents, should not converse with &amp; woman, or a sūdra, should gee no one else except ber husband, since the child born becomes like the male whom a woman taking a bath after the period looks at. Saṅkba-Likhita convey a similar eugenio suggestion, 678 viz. &ldquo;Women give birth to a child similar in qualities to him on whomsoever their heart is set in their periods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A debatable question is whether garbhadhāna is a samskāra of the garbha (the child in the womb) or of the woman. Gaut. VIII. 24, Manu. L 16, and Yāj. I. 10 indicate that it is a samskāra of the garbha and not of the woman. Viśvarūpa &ldquo;TT on Yaj. 1. 11 expressly aggerts that all samskāras except Simantonnayana have to be performed again and again (as they are the saṁskāras of the garbha ), wbile Simantonnayans being a samskāra of the woman has to be performed only once and this opinion was in consonance with the usage in his days. Laghu-Aśvaldyana ( IV. 17) also holds the same view. Medha tithi 478 on Manu IL 16 says that the garbhadhāna rite with mantras was performed after marriage only once at the time of the first cohabitation according to some, while according to</p>

<p>otbers it was to be performed after every menstruation till conception. Later works like the Mit. (on Yaj. I. 11), the Sm. C., the Samskāratattva (p. 909 ) hold that garbhādhāna, pumsavada 479 and Bimantonnayana are samskāras of the woman and are to be performed only once and quote Hārita in support. Aparārka holds that slmantonnayana is performed only once at the first conoeption, while puinsavana is repeated at esch conception. He relies on Pār, gr. I. 15; and the Sams kāra-mayūkha and the Samskāraprakāśa (pp. 170-171) hold the same opinion. Sm. O.( I. p. 17 ) quotes a verse of Viṣṇu that Bocording to some even simantonnayana is repeated at each conception. About the rules for women who are rajasvalā (in their monthly course ) vide later on.</p>
<p>According to Kullūka (on Manu II, 27), the Sm. O. (I. p. 14) and other works garbhādhāna is not of the nature of homa. The Dharmasindhu says that when garbhādhāna takes place on the first appearance of menses, homa for garbhādhāna is to be performed in the gṛbya fire, but there is no homa when the cohabitation takes place on the second or later appearance of menses ; that those in whose sūtra no home is prescribed should perform the garbhādhāna rite on the proper day after the first appearance of menses by reciting the mantras but without homa. The Samskarakaustubha (p. 59 ) relying on Gshyapari sista prescribes homa in which cooked food is to be offered to Prajapati and seven offerings of ājy&amp; are to be offered in fire, three with the verses &lsquo;Viṣṇur-yonim&rsquo; (Rg. X. 181. 1-3), three with &rsquo;nejameṣa&rsquo;( Ap. M. P. I. 12, 7–9) and one with Rg. X. 121. 10 ( prajapate na ).</p>
<p>All samskāras other than garbhādhāng can be performed by any agnate in the absence of the husband ( vide Samskāra prakāśa 480 p. 165 ).</p>

<p>Samskāras and homa</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>As homa is necessary in numerous ceremonies and rites, the gphyasūtras give a description of a model boma. Therefore here also it would be well to set out the description from the Aśvalāyana 481 Giphyasūtra ( I. 3, S. B. E. vol 29 pp. 162-163 ), a few important points of difference being added from other gphyasūtras and other works.</p>
<p>&quot; Now wherever ( a person ) intends 48% to offer a sacrifice he should besmear ( with cowdung ) a sthandila (slightly raised equare surface of sand or loose earth) of the dimension at least of an arrow on all (four) sides ; let him then draw six lines (in all) on it, one to the west ( of that part of the sthandila on which the fire is to be placed ) but turned northwards, two lines turned towards the east but separately at the two ends (of the line first drawn); (then he should draw ) three lines in the middle (of the two); let him then sprinkle (the sacred sthandila) with water, establish the ( sacred ) fire (on the sthandila ), put (two or three Bamidhs) on the fire; then he should perform parisamūhana (i. e. wiping or gweeping the ground round the fire), then paristarana ( i. e, strewing darbha grass round) to the east. to the south, to the west, to the north ( in order); in this way (all acts like parisamūbana, paristarana &amp;o.) should end in the north. Then silently he should sprinkle (water) round (the fire). (2) With two (kusa blades used as ) strainers ( pavitra ) the purifying of the djya is done. (3) Having 83 taken two kuga blades with unbroken ends, which do not bear &amp; young shoot in them, of the measure of a span, at their ends with his thumb and fourth finger, with hands turned the inside being upwards, he purifies the ajya (from the west) towards the east with (the words) by the urging of Savitç I purify thee with this uninjured pavitra, with the rays of the Vasu ( i. e. rioh or good ) sun&rsquo;, once with this mantra, twice silently. (4) The strewing of kuga grass ( paristarana ) round the fire may or may not be done in the djya homas ( i. e. sacrifices in which clarified butter alone is to be offered into the fire ). (5) So also the two ājya portions (may optionally be offered) in the Pakayajñas. (6) And ( the</p>

(7) He should offer the sacrifice with the words &rsquo;to suoh and such a deity, svāha&rsquo;. (8) If there is no specific direction ( as to the deities to whom the offerings are to be made ), the deities are Agni, Indra, Prajāpati, Vigve Devas ( all gods), Brahma. 484 At the end there is an offering to Agni Sviṣtakrt (vide Appendix under note 481 for the mantra ).</p>
<p>In the Saṅkhāyana gr. I. 7 (S. B. E. vol. 29 pp. 22-31 ) the procedure described is more elaborate and contains some important differences. The performer (I. 7. 6-7) draws one line in the middle of the sacrifioial surface from south to north and from this line only three lines are drawn upwards, one to the south of it, one in the middle, and one to the north ( i. a. there are only four lines and not six as in Āśvalāyana ). Further it ( I. 8. 6-7 ) says that the seat of the brahmā priest is to the south of the sthandila and he is honoured with flowers. Sāṅkhāyana adds ( I. 8. 8.) the detail that the pranita waters are carried forward on the north side and (I 8. 9-11) that paristarana follows after the carrying forward of the pranita waters. It also adds (I. 8. 24-25 ) that waters in the sruva spoon are purified just as ajya is purified and then a portion of the water in the sruva is poured on to the pranitā water and the rest of the water in the sruva is called the prokṣanl water with which the havis, the idhma (fuel) and barnis (kuśas) are sprinkled. Saṅkhāyana I. 9. 1 lays down that sruva spoon is the vessel in all gshya rites ( and not juhū as in srauta rites ) except where a special rule to the contrary is stated. The Pār. 87. I 1(8. B. E. vol. 29, pp. 269-270 ) and the Kbādira gr. L2 (8. B. E. vol. 29, pp. 376-378) describe the model homa in a very concise manner. The Gobhila gs. (1. 1. 9-11, and I. 5. 13-20, I. 7. 9, 1. 8. 21), Hir. gr. (1. 1. 9-I. 3.7 8. B. E, vol. 30 pp. 138-145 ) describe it at great length. The sthandila should be prepared on a level spot or on &amp; spot that slopes towards the east or north or north-east ( vido Hir. gr. I. 1. 9, S. B. E. vol. 30, p. 138). The sthandila should be raised to the height</p>

<p>The brabmā is the only priest ( out of the four principal Ftviks ) in sacrifices that are offered in one fire (i. e. in the gshya fire ) and are called pākayajñas and the yajamāna (sacrificer) is himself the hotr priest. «88 The order of the several parts in the homa is as follows : 487 upalepana (smearing with cowdung ), arranging of sthandila with sand or earth; drawing lines on the sthapdila with a samidh (fuel stick), keeping the samidh on the lines with its end towards the east, sprinkling sthandila with water on its north or east, keeping the samidh ( with whioh lines were drawn) outside the sthandila towards the north-east, then acamana ( by the sacrificer), then placing fire ( either produced by attrition or brought from the house of a śrotriya or the ordinary one ) on the sthandila faoing the performer, placing two or three samidhs on the fire, keep ing ready of idhma (15 samidhs) and a bunch of darbha grass.

Then the principal oblations as directed in the various sūtras, then finally an oblation to Agni Sviṣtakpt. The method of offering an oblation is to repeat the mantra preceded by om and to add svāhā at the end, to put the ahuti ( oblation) on fire and to say &rsquo;this is for such and such a god and not mine&rsquo;, 489</p>
<p>The Asv. grbye-sūtra (I. 4) further adds that in caula, upanayana, godāna and marriage there are ( as part of these ceremonies ) first four oblations of clarified butter to be made with the three mantras (Rg. IX. 66. 10-12) &lsquo;Oh Angi, thou purifiest life &amp;o&rsquo; and with the one verso Prajapatil no other than thou &amp;c&rsquo; (Rg. X. 121. 10) or with the vyābstis, *89 or</p>

It consists in placing tho several vessels to the north of tbo fire on darbha grass in pairs with both baods, the faces of the vessels being turned down. Then he takes two blades (as desoribed in Adv. gr. I. 3. 4) as pavitras and places thom in the prokpapapatra the face of which is turned up and pours water in the prokpana pātra and thrice purifies the water with them, then the othor vessels are turned upwards, the bundle of idbma is loosenod and all vessels are sprinkled with water, then the prap itxpatra is placed to the west of the fire, the two pavitras (kusa blades usod as strainers are placed inside it and water is poured into the pranita patra and 88ndalwood paste is mixed with it, the vessel is raised level with ono&rsquo;s nose and placed to the north of the fire on darbhas, and covered with darbhas. This is patrapadana. Norāyana mentions also other acts not specified by Asvaldyana which may be done oven by a person following that satra viz, carrying a firebrand (burning blade of darbba ) round the clarified butter and cleansing of sruo and stuva, and throwing of the rope that tied together idhma into the fire at the end of the oblation to Svipta krt.</p>

<p>In modern times, after the sthandila is sprinkled with water, fire is established on it under various names depending on the rite to be performed e. g. in upanayang and marriage respec tively the fire is called &ldquo;&lsquo;Samudbhava&rsquo; and &lsquo;Yojaka&rsquo;. Then fuel sticks already sprinkled with holy water are placed on the fire and it is fanned into a flame and prayer is offered to it in the words &lsquo;agne Vaisvānara Sāndilya meṣadhvaja mama sammukho Varado bhava&rsquo;. Then follow parisamūhana and other acts stated above.</p>
<p>Just as homa is required in most gļhya rites there are certain matters common to almost all rites. One is that in all samskāras one has to feed brāhmaṇas learned in the Vedas.498 All rites begin with acamana by the performer, prāṇāyāma by him, reference to the desa (place) and kala (time) and a saṅkalpa ( a declaration of what rite he is performing and for what purpose). After these, according to medieval works, follow in all auspicious rites the worship of Ganapati, pupyābavicana, the worship of Mātrs (mother goddessess) and Nandiørāddha. According to some there is only one saṅkalpa for all these ; according to others there is a separate saṇkalpa for each of punyābayacana, matrkāpūjana and Nandiārāddba. In all auspicious rites the performer takes a bath first, ties his topknot, has a piece of ground cowdunged and lines with coloured materials are drawn on a portion of the ground, two auspicious kalasas ( jars ) filled with water are placed on such ornamented ground with their mouths covered with a pot, all articles neceszary for worship are placed to the north of the spot, two</p>

<p>wooden low stools or planks are arranged to the west of the spot so decorated, the performer sits on one plank facing the east, bis wife sits to his right and if the ceremony is meant for his son, the latter sits to the right of the wife; the brāhmapas are seated a little away to the right of the wife, facing the north and the performer sips water (takes acamana).

<p>Ganapatipūjana :&ndash;This consists in inviting the presence of the elephant-faced god Gapeśa on a betelnut placed in a handful of husked rice. The word Ganapati is used in the Rgveda as an attribute of Brabmaṇaspati ( the lord of prayer or holy lora ). The well-known mantra (&lsquo;gaṇānām tvā ganapatim havāmabe&rsquo; Rg.

S. paśus ( and the horse specially ) are said to be the Gāpapatya of Rudra. The Ait, Br. IV. 4 495 expressly says that the mantra &lsquo;ganānām tva&rsquo; is addressed to Brahmaṇaspati. In the Vāj. S. 16. 25 we have the plural (Ganapatibhyalok vo namo&rsquo;) and in 22. 30 we have the singular &lsquo;Ganapataye svāhā&rsquo;. The peculiar features of Gañesa as described in the medieval works, viz. the head of an elephant, pot belly, mouse as vābana ( conveyance) are entirely wanting in the Vedic literature. In Vāj. S. III. 57 the mouse *** is said to be the pasu (animal to be offered to ) of Rudra. In the Tai. Ār. (X. 15 ) there is a verse 197 &lsquo;We contemplate Vakratunda, therefore may the tusked ( god ) impel us&rsquo;. In the Gșhya and Dharma sūtras there is no reference to the worship of Ganesa at the beginning of all auspicious rites. That is comparatively a later cult. In the Baud. Dh. 8. (II. 5. 83-90, 8. B. E. vol. 14. p. 254) the Devatarpana includes the propitia tion of Vighna, Vinayaka, Vira, Sthūla, Varada, Hastimukha,</p>

<p>Vakratunda, Ekadanta and Lambodara. But this part of the Baud. Dh. 8, is of doubtful authenticity. All the above are the appellations of Vinayaka (vide Baud. gļhya-seṣasūtra III. 10,6). In the Mānava grbya II. 14 it is said that the Vināyakas are four viz. Sālakatankaṭa, Kūṣmāndarājaputra, Usmita and Devayajana. They are evil spirits and people when seized by them have bad dreams and see in them inauspicious sights such as shaved persons, persons with matted hair or wearing yellowish garments, camels, hogs, asses, cāṇdālas. When seized by them, princes, though capable, do not get their king doms ; maidens, though endowed with all accomplishments, cannot secure husbands; married women have no children or even virtuous wives lose their children in infancy; husbandmen lose their crops &amp;o. The Mānavagshya then prescribes propi. tiatory rites to remove the effects of Vināyaka seizure. The Baija vāpagphya (quoted by Aparārka p.563 on Yaj. I. 275) Bays** that there are four Vināyakas, Mita, Sammita, Salakataokata and Kūṣmaṇdarājaputra and describes seizure by tbem and its effects in the same way 88 the Mānavagphys. These two show the first stage in the development of the cult of Vināyaka. Vinayakas are at this stage malevolent spirits who cause dangers and obstacles of various kinds. In this cult various elements from the terrific aspects of Rudra were probably first drawn upon and amalgamated with other elements drawn from aboriginal cults. The next stage is indicated by the Yāj. smrti (I. 271-294). Hers Vinayaka ( I. 271 ) is said to be one appoin ted by Brahmā and Rudra to the over-lordship of the Gaṇas, be is represented not only as causing obstacles, but also as bring ing success in the actions and rites undertaken by men. Yāj, enumerates the results of the seizure by Vinayaka in the same way 88 the Mānavagshya, Yaj. I. 285 says that Mita, Sammita, Salakatankata and Kūṣmāṇdarajaputra are the four names 299 of the one Vinayaka and that Ambika is the mother of Vinayaka. It is noteworthy that Yāj. does not</p>

<p>Though Vidvartpa and Apararka take these to be four, it is ourious tbat the Mit. makes them to be six ( viz. Sala and Kataokata as distinct and so also Kaṣmaqda and Rajaputra ).

<p>employ any one of the well-known epithets of Vinayaka, viz. Ekadanta, Heramba, Gajānana, Lambodara &amp;o. The Baud. gf. segasūtra III. 10 prescribes &amp; somewhat different procedure for propitiating Vinayaka and styles him &rsquo;the lord of bhūtas&rsquo;, and also hastīmukha&rsquo; and &lsquo;vighnesvara&rsquo; and prescribes the offerings of apūpa and modaka to him. Thus Baudhāyana is nearer to the medieval conception of Ganesa than even Yajna valkya. The Adiparva makes Ganese write the Mahabharata to the dictation of Vyasa ; but this part is apocryphal as many mes, altogether omit this episode (vide J. R. A. 8. for 1898 pp. 380-384, Winternitz). The other references in Vanaparva 65. 23 and Anusāsana 150, 25 bear affinity to the description of Vinayaka in the Mānavagļhya. 500</p>
<p>The Gobhilasmrti (in verse) I. 13 prescribes that at the begin ning of all rites, the Mātrs together with Gaṇādhipa (the lord of Ganas ) should be worshipped. The well-known characteristics of Ganesa and his worship had become fixed before the 5th or 6th century of the Christian era. Kālidāsa does not refer to Ganesan The Gathāsaptaśati has references to Ganesa. In that work (IV. 72) an image of Gaṇeśa is referred to as made use of 88 a pillow and the tip of his trunk is mentioned in V. 3. In Codrington&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ancient India&rsquo; plate XXXIX there is an image of Ganesa referable to about 500 A. D. Vide Dr. Bhandarkar in. Vaiṣṇavism and Saivism&rsquo; p. 147. Bāṇa in his Harsacarita (IV Ucobvāsa verse 2 ) speaks of the large tusk of Gapādhipa and in describing Bhairavācārya ( Harṣacarita III) associates Vinayaka with obstacles and learning and also indicates that he had the head of an elephant. In the Vāmanapurāṇa (obap. 54 ) there is a fantastic legend about the birth of Vinayake</p>
<p>The Mahaviracarita ( II. 38 ) speaks of the tusk of Heramba, The Matsyapurāṇa (chap. 260.52-55 ) describes how the images of Vinayaka are to be made. Aparārka (p. 343 ) quotes a pass age from the Matsyapurāṇa ( 289.7) on the mahādana called Mahābhūtaghata, in which it is said that Vinayaka should be shown as riding a mouse. The Kr̥tyaratnākara p. 271 quotes a passage from the Bhaviṣyapurāpa for the worship of Ganese on the 4th day of Bhadrapada. Vide Agnipurāṇa chap. 71 and 313.</p>

<p>The Ganapatipājāna consists in the performer repeating the mantra Rg. II. 23. 1 (&lsquo;gaṇānām tvā Ganapatim&rsquo;) AS a prayer and then bowing to Ganeśa with the words &lsquo;Om Maha ganapataye namo namaḥ nirvighnam kuru&rsquo; (Balutations to the great Ganapati, make ( this rite ) free from obstacles&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Punyāhavācana :-Although many elaborate descriptions of this are given in later digests like the Samskāraratnamala, this was originally in ancient times a very simple and brief rite. The Ap. Dh. S, ( I. 4. 13. 8 ) says that in ordinary life in all auspicious rites ( such as marriage ) all sentences begin with &lsquo;Om&rsquo;as in saying &lsquo;punyābam&rsquo;, &lsquo;svasti&rsquo;, and &lsquo;?ddhim&rsquo;. The performer of a religious rite honours the assembled brahmaṇas with gandha (sandalwood paste ), flowers and tāmbula (botel leaves ) and requests with folded hands &lsquo;may you declare the day to be auspicious for such and such a ceremony which I, by name so and so, am 508 about to perform and then the brahmaṇas</p>

<p>Matrkāpūiana &ndash;The Matrs (the Mother Goddesses ) do not figure in the sūtras. But that their worship was prevalent certainly in the first centuries of the Christian era throughout India oan be proved from several sources. In the drama Mroohakatika (I) Cārudatta asks his friend Maitraya to offer bali to the Matss. The Gobhila-smrti 504 (in verse I. 11-12) names 14 mātṛs viz. Gaurl, Padma, Saci, Medhā, Sāvitri, Vijaya, Jaya, Devasenā, Svadhā, Svāhā, Dhști, Pusti, Tuṣti and one&rsquo;s own deity (abhiṣta-deyatā ). In the Mārkandeya (chap. 88. 11-20 and 38) seven mātrs have been named as Mātrgana. The Matsyapurāṇa (chap. 179. 9-32) names over a hundred mother goddesses (like Mahesvari, Brāhmi, Kaumāri, Cāmunda ), while in chap. 261 (24-36 ), there is a description of the images of some of the matrs like Brahmāṇi &amp;o. The Bṭbat-Samhita of Varāhamihira (chap.58 56) refers to the images of the mother goddesses. Bāṇa in his Kā dambari frequently refers to the mātrs, to their worship and to dila pidated temples of these goddesses.505 The Kr̥tyaratnākara quotes a passage from the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa at p. 261 about the images of the seven mātṛs and pp. 305 and 307 quote the Devipurāṇa about the worship of mātṛs and the flowers dear to them. The worship of matrs is mentioned in the Bibar Stone Pillar Inscription of Skandagupta (Gupta Inscriptions pp. 47, 49). The Cālukyas are often described as cherished by the seven mātrs&rsquo; (1. A. vol. VI. p.73 in 535 śake and E. I. vol. IX, p. 100 in 660 A. D.). The Kadambas are described as meditating on Kārtikeya-gvāmi and on the group of mātra (I. A. vol. VI. p. 25 ) 508.

<p>Whence the cult of mātrs, which was not described in the Gphyasūtras, was derived it is difficult to say. Sir John Mar shall in his famous work on Mohenjo-Daro ( vol. I. p. VII and pp. 49-52 and plates XII, XOIV and XCV ) shows how figurines of mother goddesses are common at Mohenjo Daro. That shows that the oult prevailed in the remotest antiquity and was probably taken up by the followers of the Vedic religion and affiliated to the worship of Durgā, the spouse of Śiva. In Rg. IX. 102.4 509 the seven mothers are said to regulate soma when it is being prepared ( the seven mothers are probably the seven metres or the seven rivers ).</p>

<p>Pursavana :&ndash;This rite is so called because in virtue of it a male is born,508 The word &lsquo;puinsuvana&rsquo; occurs in the Atharva veda VI. 11. 1 where 509 it appears to be used literally (in the sense of giving birth to a male child&rsquo;) &lsquo;The Asvattha tree is on top of the Saml tree, there the birth of a male has been effected&rsquo;. The Āsv. gṛ. I. 13. 2-7 describes the rite as follows: &lsquo;he should in the third month of pregnancy, under the constel. lation Tiṣya (i. e. Pusya ) give ( tbrice) to eat to the wife, after she has fasted, (on the preceding Punarvasu constellation) in the curds of a cow which has &amp; calf of the same colour (with the cow ) two beans and one grain of barley for each handful of curds. On his asking ( the woman) &lsquo;what dost thou drink? what dost thou drink?&rsquo;, she should thrice reply &lsquo;pumaayana&rsquo;, (generation of a male ), &lsquo;puṁsavana&rsquo;. In this way (he) should make her take three handfuls (of ourds with two beans and barley ),&rsquo;$10</p>

<p>nayana and Ap. says it may be performed when pregnanoy becomes apparent. Instead of two beans and a barley grain in ourds, he requires the bringing of a shoot of the branch of 8 nyagrodha tree which ( tree ) points eastward or northward and which has two ( fruits that look like ) testicles and the pounding of the shoot and fruits by a girl who has not attained puberty between two upper stones of ( two mills) with water. He then prescribes that the wife should lie down on her back to the west of the fire herself facing the east and that the husband should insert in her right nostril the pounded substance with his thumb with the formula (pumsayanam-asi) found in Ap.M.P.(II. 11.14). San. gr. (1. 20, S. B. E. vol. 29. p. 46 ) says that the rite may be performed on Tiṣya or Srāvana, while the Bhāradvāja gr. (I. 22 ) says that it may be performed on Tiṣya or Hasta or Anurādbā or Uttarā or Prostbapada; Paraskara and Baijavāpa say it should be performed when the moon is in conjunction with a male nakṣatra. 519 Pār. gr. I. 14 and Jātūkarnya (Sam. Pr. p. 167) and Baijavāpa (ibid.) say that the rite should be per formed in the 2nd or 3rd month of pregnancy, Aśv., Hir., San., Gobbila, Khādira prescribe the third month. Yaj. I. 11, Pār. gr. (I. 14 ), Vippu Dh. S. 27. 2 and Brbaspati ( quoted in the Sm. C.) say that pumaavana should be performed before the foetus begins to move or throb in the womb. In the Kathaka gr. 32. ? the proper time is said to be when the greater number of months of pregnanoy are past (i. e. after the 5th ) and the Mānava gr. says that it should be performed in the 8th month of pregnancy.

<p>of sigtas is to perform it in the 8th month and Brahmabala ( another com.) says that the usage is to perform it in the 7th or 8th month of pregnancy. Most of the grhyasūtras refer to the pounding of the shoot#18 of the Nyagrodha tree (or some other plant) and inserting the pounded substance in the wife&rsquo;s right nostril. The mantras repeated when inserting the substance in ber nostril are different according to most sūtras. Saṅkhayana (8. B.E. vol. 29, p. 46) prescribes the four verses Rg. I. 1.3, III. 4.9., V. 37. % and IX 3. 9. with svahā at the end of each verse. Pāraskara (S. B. E. vol. 29, p. 292) prescribes Vaj. S. XIII. 4 (Rg. X. 121. 1) and XXXI. 17; Khādira gr. (S. B. E, vol. 29. p. 394 ) mentions Mantra-Brāhmaṇa I. 4. 8, the Kathaka gr. quotes Kathaka Samhita. The several sūtras of the Black Yajurveda show the greatest divergence among themselves.</p>
<p>It would be clear that the puṁsavana rite has several elements, religious (home and son&rsquo;s importance from ancient times), symbolical or suggestive ( the drinking of ourds with beans and grain of barley ) and medioal (inserting some substance in the woman&rsquo;s nostrils). For what purpose the placing of the bile of a tortoise on the woman&rsquo;s lap was prescribed by Pāraskara alone ( I. 14 ) it is difficult to say,</p>
<p>Later works like the Samskāraratnamālā prescribe a homa for pumsavana also and remark that when in the absence of the husband, the husband&rsquo;s brother or other relative performs the rite, it should be performed in ordinary kitohen fire (p. 815 ). This latter rule applies to Simantonnayana also.</p>
<p>Anavalobhana or Garbharakṣama :-This rite was apparently part of Pursavana, Āāv. gf., as already said, separately men tions purgavana and anavalobhana 88 referred to in the Upaniṣad. The Baijavāpa gļ. ( quoted in the Samskārapra kaśa p.171) says &lsquo;He performs the purgavana and anavalobbana in the fortnight of the waxing moon on an auspicious day when the moon is in conjunction with a nakṣatra (deemed to be ) a male&rsquo;. This shows that both were performed on the same day. Another sutra of Baijavāpa quoted in the Samskāramayūkha $14 says that the two are to be performed in the 2nd or 3rd month</p>

<p>of pregnancy. This rite is so called because by virtue of its performance the foetus does not fall out or is not destroyed (i. e. it is really anavalopana from the root lup with ava). Aśv. gr. (I. 13. 5-7) describes it as follows: He then inserts in her right nostril in the shade of a round apartment the (sap) of an herb which is not faded : 515 according to some ( teachers ), with the Prajāvat and Jiyaputra mantras. Having offered a sacrifice of cooked food to Prajapati he should touch the region of her heart with the verge Oh thou whose hair is well parted, what is hidden in thy heart, in Prajāpati, that I understand, (mayst thou understand ) me who know that; inay not injury to the son be my lot&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the inserting of dūrvārasa in the woman&rsquo;s nostril, touching her heart and prayers to the gods for the safety of the foetus are the principal features of this rite in Asv.</p>
<p>Acoording to Saunaka-kārikā ( Ms. in Bombay University Library, folio 138 ) that rite is called anavalobhana whereby the foetus remains undisturbed or does not fall out. 516 According to the Smstyarthasāra it is to be performed in the fourth month. According to Laghu-Asyalāyana IV.1-2 anavalobhana and simantonnayana were to be performed in the 4th, 6th or 8th month of pregnancy and verses 6-7 give the same details as in Āśv. gļ.</p>
<p>The San. gr. (I. 21. 1-3, S. B. E. vol. 29, p. 47 ) speaks of &amp; ceremony called Garbharakṣaṇa (protection of the foetus): &quot; In the fourth month the garbharakṣaṇa; offering six oblations into fire from a mess of cooked food with the six verses of the hymn brabmanāgnih &lsquo;517 (Rg. X. 162 ) with svāha uttered at the end of each verse, with the verses &lsquo;from thy eyes, thy nose&rsquo; (Rg. X. 163. 1-6), besmearing her limbs with clarified butter at each verse. &quot;</p>

<p>This seems to be anothor version of anavalobhana.</p>
<p>According to Asv. gr. kārikās of Kumārila (I. 6.5) this rite is to be repeated on every conception. Most other writers would hold that like pumsavana it is to be performed only once.</p>
<p>Ṣimantonnayana :&ndash;This is treated in the following gr. sūtras: Asv. I. 14. 1-9; San. I. 22, Ap. 14. 1-8, Hir. II. 1, Baud. I. 10, Bhāradvāja I. 21, Gobhila II. 7.1-12, Khādira II. 2. 24-28, Pār. I. 15, Kāthaka 31. 1-5, Vaikhānasa IIL 12.</p>
<p>This word literally means &lsquo;parting of the hair (of a woman) upwards.&rsquo; Yaj. (1. 11), Veda-Vyasa ( I. 18 ) oall this ganskāra simply &lsquo;simanta&rsquo;, while Gobhila ( II. 7.1), Mānava gr. (1.12.2), Kāthaka gp (31.1) call it simantakarana. Ap. gr. and Bhāra dvāja gr. (I. 21 ) describe it before pumsavana. The Asv. gr. ( I. 14. 1-9 ) describes it as follows: &ldquo;In the fourth month of pregnancy the Simantonnayana (should be performed). In the fortnight of the waxing moon,when the moon may be in conjunc tion with &amp; nakṣatra that is ( regarded as ) male (or the name of which is of the magouline gender, according to Nārāyaṇa ); then he establishes fire (i. e. performs the details of homa up to offering of ūjyabhāgas ) and having spread to the west of the fire a bull&rsquo;s hide with its neck to the east and the hair outside, he makes eight oblations (of ajya, clarified butter), while his wife sits on it ( hide) and takes hold (of his hand ), with the two ( verses) may Dhātr give to his worshipper&rsquo; (Atharvaveda VII. 17. 2-3 ), with the two verses, &lsquo;I invoke Rakā&rsquo; (Rg. II. 32. 4-5), with the three (verses) called &rsquo;nejameṣa&rsquo; (a khilasūkta after Rg. X. 184 and Āp. M. P. I. 12. 7-9) and with the verse &lsquo;Oh Prajāpati, no one other than you&rsquo; (Rg. X. 121. 10). He then three times parts her hair upwards (beginning from the front and pro ceeding backwards ) with a bunch of an even number of unripe fruits with a porcupine quill that has three white spota 518 ( or rings ) and with three bunches of kusa grass, with the words &lsquo;bhūr, bhuvaḥ, svar, om&rsquo; or he does so four times. He gives orders to two lute players&rsquo;sing (praise of) king soma.&rsquo; (They sing this gāthā ) may some, our king, bless the human race.</p>

<p>Simantonnayana</p>
<p>223</p>
<p>Fixed is the wheel ( dominion) of this (river); (here they take the name in the vocative ) of the river near which they dwell, And let them do whatever aged brāhmana women whose hus. bands and children are alive direct. A bull is the fee ( for the sacrifice)&rdquo;. In the Āp. mantrapatha thirteen verges are devoted to this samskāra in all, some of which occur in the Rs., the Atharvaveda and Tai, S..</p>
<p>We have here first the religious part of home and oblations with mantras. But this rite is mainly of a social and festival nature intended to keep the pregnant woman in good cheer. The Samskāraprakāśa ( pp. 172-173 ) quotes some verses from an Asyalāyana stating that this rite serves the purpose of driving certain female goblins that thirst for the destruction of the foetus; the parting of the hair by the husband with the quill, bunch of unripe fruits and darbhas and tying a garland round her neok, giving her boiled rice mixed with mudga and ghee and asking lute players to sing indicate its festive character. There is a great divergence among the gphya sutras about the several details of this samskāra and the order in which they take place. The Sm. O. after pointing out a few divergences remarks that one should follow the rules of one&rsquo;s own grbya sutra. A few important divergences are pointed out below. This samskāra was to be performed in the 3rd month according to Kāthaka gr., in 3rd, 6th or 8th according to the Mānava; in the 4th month according to Aśv., Ap., Hir. (II. 1 ), in 4th or 6th according to Gobhila (II. 7. 2) and in the 4th, 6th or 8th according to Khadira, in 6th or 8th according to Paraskara, Yaj. (I. 11), Viṣṇu Dh. S. ( 27. 3), Saṅkha; in the 7th according to Sān. gr. (I. 22. 1), in the 8th according to Vaik, and Veda-Vyāsa (1. 18). Saṅkha as quoted in the Smsticandrikā (I. p. 17) says that it should be performed on the foetus beginning to move and up to the time of delivery, Āśv., Sānand Hir. require that the moon must be in conjunc tion with a malo nakṣatra. Hir. gr. alone prescribes that the samnskāra should take place in a round apartment. It is remark able that Āśv. alone requires that the woman should be beated on a bull&rsquo;s hide, which shows that till his day such a hide was not treated (as is done in modern times) as a very unholy thing. Pāraskara makes her sit on &amp; soft chair or seat, while Gobhila prescribes a seat of northward pointed darbhas. There is great divergence as to the number of oblations and the verses to be repeated even in sutras of the same Veda, e. g. Asta layana prescribes eight oblations and eight mantras, but</p>
<p>224</p>
<p>Wisband is to that it was in and thr</p>
<p>Śānkhāyana prescribes only six (by omitting the verses Rg. II. 32. 4-5). Gobhila, Khadira, Bhāradvāja, Paraskara and Saṅkhāyana prescribe the preparation of boiled rice with ghee thereon or sesame and the first three of these say that the woman should be asked to look at the ghee on the mass of rice and be questioned &lsquo;what do you see&rsquo; and she should be made to reply &lsquo;I see progeny&rsquo; (Bhāradvāja has the reply &lsquo;sons and cattle&rsquo;). Almost all gļhya sūtras agree that in parting the hair the husband is to use a bunch of unripe fruit (Gobhile, Pār, and Sān, specifying that it was to be Udumbara fruit), a poroupine quill with three white spots and three bunches of kusa grass. Pāraskara and Gobhila add the use of a Viratara stick and a full spindle. Some like Aśv. presoribe that the parting must be done thrice, Gobhila seems to prescribe it six times, while Khādira ( II. 2. 25 ) expressly says that it is to be done only once. Sān, says that the unripe fruits are to be tied to a string of three twisted threads and the string is to be sus pended from her neck as a garland. Par. also seems to suggest the same. Ap. also says that the husband should (by way of ornament) tie a string of barley grains with young shoots on the woman&rsquo;s bead (14.7) and Vaikhānasa says that the woman is to wear a garland and have fragrant unguents applied to her body. Many of the gshya sūtras direct that lute players should sing a verse or verses. Gobhila, Khadira, Vaik, are silent on this point, but Gobhila prescribes that brāhmaṇa women should address auspioious words to her &lsquo;Be you the mother of a valiant son.&rsquo; There is divergence as to whose praise is to be sung. San and Pār. say that the ballad sung must be in praise of the (ruling) king or any one else who is very valiant. ĀśV., Hir., Baud., Bhāradvāja and Pār. prescribe a gāthā in honour of king Soma (the plant). Apastamba refers to two verses, one of which praises king Yaugandhari and the other king Soma and presoribes that the first is to be sung for all varṇas residing in the Salve countries, while the second is to be recited by brahmanas. Some of the sūtras like Asv., Pār., Bhāradvāja allow that in the ballad to be sung by the lute players the river on which the woman and her husband dwell is to be invoked. 519</p>

<p>Aøv, and Sān, expressly state that a bull is the fee in this samskāra for the officiating priest, Ap., Pār, and Bhāradvāja say that brāhmaṇas are to be fed in this rite. Sān, says that the woman is to sing merrily and wear gold ornaments if she likes. The Ap. and Bhāradvāja gr. say that the husband is to observe silence that day till the stars begin to appear and then after going out of the house from the east or north, he should first touch a calf and then mutter the vyāhrtis (bhūh, bhuvaḥ, svaḥ ) and give up his silence.580</p>

It may be inferred with sone force that Ap. mantropātha and Hir. g! were composed in the Salve country on the banks of the Junna and the Bharadrāja g? on the Ganges. Haradatta explaining Ap gr. says that the country of Salva is on the Jumpa and that Vaidyas are in abundance there. The country of Salva was included in the Kaccbādigaṇa (Papini V. 2. 133, and Mahābhāṣya, vol. II. p. 300 ). Panini mentions Salva in IV. 1, 173, IV. 2. 135 and teachos the formation of Yaugand bara in IV, 2. 130 and of Yaugandhari in IV. 1. 173. In the Vana parva 14, 1-5 it is said that the king of Salve whose ca pital was at Saubha attacked Dyāraka. Salyaparva (20.1) calls the Salva king lord of mleccha tribes and speaks of him as fighting for Duryodhana and as killed by Satyaki. A Karike quoted by the Kusika makes Yaugandharaadivision of Salva &lsquo;उदुम्बरास्तिलखला भद्रकारा युगन्धराः। इलिङ्गा शरवण्वाश्व साल्वाषषयसंशिताः&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Apastamba, Baud., Bhāradvāja and Pār. expressly say that this saṁskāra is to be performed only onoe at the first conception. For the difference of view among nibandhakāras vide above ( pp. 205-206 ) on garbhādbāna.</p>
<p>Viṣṇu was of opinion that sīmantonnayana is a samskāra of the woman, but that according to some it is &amp; samskāra of the foetus and so was to be repeated at each conception.581 On account of the great divergence of details one may conjecture that this samskāra was not very ancient in the times of the Gșhyasūtras.</p>
<p>It appears however that gradually this picturesque rite. receded in the back ground, so much so that Manu does not even mention it by name, though Yāj. namas it. In modern times in Western India some people perform a rite in the 8th inonth of pregnancy (called in Marathi Athangulen) which retains some vestiges of the ancient rite (such as the garland of udumbara fruit).</p>
<p>Viṣṇubali :- According to Vasistha quoted in the Samnskāre. prakāśa (p. 178 ) this ceremony was to be performed in the 8th month of pregnancy, on the 2nd, 7th or 12th tithi of the bright fortnight and when the moon was in the Śravaṇa, Rohiṇī or Puṣya constellation. The same work quotes verses of Aśvala. gana describing the ceremony and stating its purpose viz. to remove harm to the foetus and for easy delivery of the woman and that it was to be performed during every conception. On the preceding day Nāndiørāddha was to be performed and then boma to fire was to be performed up to the offering of ājyabhāgas. To the south of the fire another sthandila of the shape of a lotus or svastika was to be drawn on which 64 oblations of boiled rice with ghee thereon were to be offered to Viṣṇu (some offer them on the fire itself) with the verses of Rg. I. 22. 16-21, Rg. I. 154. 1-6, Rg. VI. 69.1-8, Rg. VII. 104. 11, Rg. X. 90.1-16, Rg. X. 184, 1-3. Then to the north-east of the fire, &amp; square plot should be smeared with cowdung and be divided into 64 squ. ares with white dust and 64 offerings of boiled rice should be offer. ed with the same mantras and in their midst one ball of rice should be offered to Viṣṇu with the mantra loudly uttered&rsquo; namo</p>

<p>Narayapāya &rsquo; and the husband and wife should partake separa. tely of two balls of the same rice. Then the offering to Agni Svi. stakrt should be made, dakṣiṇā should be distributed and brāb maṇas should be fed. The Vaik. (III. 13) describes Viṣṇubali differently. The gods with Agni as the first are invoked unto the northern pranidhi vessel and then at the end Puruṣa is invoked four times with &lsquo;om bhūb&rsquo;, &lsquo;om bhuyah,&rsquo; &lsquo;om suvaḥ,&rsquo; &lsquo;om bhūr-bhuvah-suvaḥ&rsquo;, then to the east of the fire he invokes Viṣṇu on seats of darbha grass with the names, Kesava, Nārāyana, Madhava, Govinda, Viṣṇu, Madhusūdana, Trivikrama, Vāmana, Sridhara, Hrṣikeśa, Padmanābha, Damodara; then he bathes Viṣṇu, with mantras &lsquo;Apah&rsquo; (Tai. S. IV.1.5.11=Rg. X. 9. 1-3), &lsquo;Hirapyavarṇāḥ&rsquo; (Tai. 8. V.6.1) and the chapter beginning</p>
<p>pavamānaḥ&rsquo; (Tai. Br. I. 4.8); he dous worship (with sandal peste, flowers &amp;c. ) by eaoh of Viṣṇu&rsquo;s twelve names, then he offers 12 oblations of clarified butter with the mantras ato devā&rsquo; (Rg. I. 22. 16-21), Viṣnor-nu kam&rsquo;(Rg. I. 154.1-7=Tai. S. I. 2. 13),&rsquo; tad-agy&amp; priyanı&rsquo;( Tai, Br. II. 4. 6 = Rg. I 154.5), &lsquo;pra tadviṣṇuḥ&rsquo; (Tai. Br. II. 4. 3 = Rg. I. 154, 2 ), &lsquo;paro mātrayā&rsquo; ( Tai. Br. II. 8. 3), vicakrame trir-devab&rsquo; ( Tai. Br. II. 8. 3). Then he announcces as offering a mess of rice cooked in milk on which ājya has been poured to the god and sacrifices it to him with the twelve names repeating the twelve mantras ( Rg. I. 22. 16-21, and Rg. I. 154. 1-6): Having praised the god with mantras from the four vedas he should prostrate himself before the god after taking twelve names with the word &rsquo;namaḥ&rsquo; at the end of each (i. e. by saying Keśavāya namah&rsquo; &amp;o.). What remains of the rice cooked in milk is eaten by the wife.</p>
<p>Soṣyantikarma :&ndash;Vide Āp. gr. 14. 13-15; Hir. gr. II. %.8 II.3.1, Bhāradvāja gr. I.2), Gobhila gr. II. 7, 13-14, Khādira gļ. II 2. 29-30, Pār, gr. I. 16, Kāṭbaka gr. 33. 1-3. This seems to be a very ancient rite. It means &rsquo; s rite for a woman who is about to be delivered of a child&rsquo;Rs. V. 78.7-9 give the earliest indications of this rite. &lsquo;Just as the wind moves a lake on all sides, so may the foetus move and come out, being (now) in the tenth month. Just as the wind, the forest and the sea are in movement, so mayst thou ( foetus ) that art ( now ) in the tenth month, come out together with the after-birth, may the male child having been sleeping ten months inside his mother, como out a living being, unharmed, from his mother, herself being alive. Br. Up. VI. 4. 23 also refers to this rite &quot; He sprinkles with water the woman who is about to be delivered ( with the mantras) just as the wind &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; may it come out with the</p>

<p>( Oh. VI</p>

This is &amp; pen 52% of Indra with a bolt and with a chamber for rest; oh Indra, leave it and come out with the foetus and after-birth.&rdquo; Āp. gļ, describes the ceremony as follows: &lsquo;Now is described the rite to secure a rapid delivery. With a cup that has not been dipped in water before he drawe water in the direction of the current (of a river or spring); he places Tūryanti plant at his wife&rsquo;s feet; he should then touch on the head (with both hands) the woman who is in child-birth with the verse ( Āp, mantra-pātha II. 11. 15 ),823 should sprinkle her with the waters ( brought as above ) with the next three verses (Ap. mantra-pātha II. 11. 16-18 ). If the after birth does not come out, he should sprinkle her with the water ( brought ) as directed above with the next two verses &lsquo;(i, e. Āp. mantra-patha II. 11 19-20).52* Hir, is very brief and is similar to Āp., but omits all verses except one (which is part of Ap. M. P. II. 11. 16). Bhāradyāja is similar to Āp., but gives verses that are slightly different from those of the Ap. M. P. Gobhila and Kbadira are very brief and say that a home with two oblations of clarified butter is to be performed with the verses of the Mantra-brāhmaṇa I 5. 6–7. Paraskara also speaks of the sprinkling of the woman with two verses of Vaj. S. VIII. 28-29 (the first being almost like Rg. V. 78.7) and prescribes the recital of Atharvaveda I. 11. 4 for the falling of the after-birth. Adityadarśana on Kathaka gr. ( 33. 1 ) remarks that this rite is not really a samskāra and Devapāla says that this is a rite which has a seen result ( while samskāras are deemed to have an unseen result).</p>
<p>Jātakarma:&ndash;This appears to have been a rite of hoary antiquity. In the Tai, S. 588 II. 2. 5. 3-4 we read &lsquo;one should offer a cake cooked on twelve potsherds to Vaiśvānara, when a</p>

<p>son is born (to a man) &hellip;&hellip; That son, for whom when born they perform this &lsquo;iṣti&rsquo;, does become pure, glorious, substantial in ( abundant) food, full of vigour and possessed of cattle &lsquo;. This shows that Vaisvānareṣti was performed on the birth of a son. Jaimini (IV. 3. 38 ) holds a discussion on this passage and establishes the conclusion that this iṣti is for the benefit of the son and not of the father and the bhāṣya of Sabara gives the further propositions that this isti is to be performed after the jātakarma rites are finished (and not immediately at birth) and that it is to be performed on a full moon day or a new moon day following ten days after birth. The Sat. Br. (9. B. E. vol. 44 p. 129 ) prescribes a certain rite before the navel string is out &ldquo;regarding a new born son let him say to five brāhmaṇas before the navel string has been out &rsquo; breathe over him in this way. But if he should be unable to obtain them, he may even himself breathe over him while walking round him&rdquo;. The Bṛ. Up. I. 5. 2 contains the following interesting passage 526 &ldquo;when a boy is born they first make him lick clarified butter, and they make him take the breast ( of the mother) after that.&rdquo; At the end of the Bs. Up. ( VI. 4. 24-28 ) there is an elaborate description of the jātakarma. &quot; When (a son) is born, having kindled the fire, having placed the son on one&rsquo;s lap, having poured curds mixed with ghee in a bell-metal vessel be offers oblations of the curds mired with ghee with the mantras &lsquo;may I maintain a thousand, prospering in my house; may there be no break with regard to progeny and cattle; svāhā! I offer to these in my mind my prāṇas, svāhal Whatever I havo done in excess in my work or whatever I may have left defi cient in this ( rite ), may the wise ( Agni) (called ) Sviṣtakt make that well sacrificed and well offered for us, svābāl&rsquo;. Then after bringing down his mouth up to the right ear of the son he should recite thrice the word &lsquo;speech&rsquo; 587, then having poured together curde, honey and olarified butter, he makes the (son) eat it by means of (a spoon of) gold not covered with anything else with the mantras &lsquo;I place in thee bhūh, I place in thee bhuvah, I place in thee syaḥ, I place in</p>

<li>The idea of inuttering vak&rsquo;thrice is that the father wishes that speech as manifested in the three Vedas inay come to the boy in due conrse. Bhuh, bhuvaḥ and svah represent the three Vedas or carth, air und heaven.</li>
</ol>
<p>230</p>
<p>( Oh. VI</p>
<p>thee bhūr-bhuvaḥ svaḥ, I place in thee all&rsquo;. Then he gives him (the boy that is born) a name with the words &rsquo;thou art the Veda&rsquo;. That becomes bis secret name. Then he hands the boy over to his mother and gives him the breast of the mother with the mantra (Rg. I. 164, 49 ) &lsquo;Oh, Sarasvati / make that breast ready for being sucked, which lies on thy body, which engenders happiness, by which thou nourishest all blessings, which bestows gems, that wins wealth and is a generous donor&rsquo;. Then he solemnly addresses the mother of the child with the following mantras &lsquo;Oh maitrāvaruṇi 528 1 Oh strong one! thou art Iļā, she ( the mother) has given birth to a valiant ( boy ); mayst thou be endowed with valiant sons, since thou hast made us possessed of &amp; valiant son. They say to him (the newly born son)&rsquo; thou indeed excellest thy father, excellest thy grand father; he may attain the highest station by his prosperity, glory and spiritual eminence, who is born as a son of such &amp; brāhmaṇa that knows this&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It will be clear from the above passages of the Bs. Up. that the jātakarma rite contained the following parts: (1) homa of ourds with ghita to the accompaniment of mantras ; (2) repeat ing in the child&rsquo;s right ear the word &lsquo;speech&rsquo; thrice; (3) making the child liok curds, honey and gbrta by means of a</p>
<p>golden ladle (or ring); (4) addressing the child with a name which was to be his secret name (nāmakarana ); (5) putting the child to the breast; (6) addressing the mother with mantras. The Satapatha adds another detail viz. asking five brābmanas if available to breathe on the child (from four quarters, east, south, west, north and one immediately above him) or the father himself may do so.</p>
<p>There is great divergence in the grhyasūtras on the diffe rent details that go to make up the jātakarma. Some give almost all the above seven details, while others omit some of them. The order of these components differs in the grhyam sūtras and according to the Veda to which each sutra is attached the mantras differ. It would be impossible to give in a brief compass the details from all grbyasūtras. Some description, however, of the details from important gļhyasūtras is given below:</p>

<p>The ceremony has to be performed by the very necessities of the case immediately after birth. But different sūtras er. press it in differant ways, e. g. Aśv. I. 15. 2 says the rite should be done before any other person (than the mother and nurse ) touches the child. Pār. gr. ( I. 16 ) says it is performed before the navel string is cut off. Gobbila ( 11.-7. 17 ) and Khadira II. 2. 32 say that it is to be performed before the navel string is cut off and the breast is given to the child..</p>
<p>In the Asv. gr. (I. 15. 1-4) the ceremony is described as follows: &ldquo;When a son has been born, he (the father ) should before other persons touch him, give to the child to eat honey and olarified butter in which gold has been rubbed by means of a golden (spoon) with the verge &lsquo;I give unto thee the Veda ( wisdom or knowledge ) of honey and ghșta, ( Veda ) which is produced by the god Savitr ( who urges on) the bountiful; may you have long life and may you live in this world for a hund. red autumns being protected by the gods&rsquo;. Bringing near the child&rsquo;s two ears ( his mouth ) the father mutters medhajanana 589 *may god Savitr bestow on thee intelligence; may the goddess Sarasvati bestow on thee intelligence and may the two gode Aśvins wearing wreaths of lotus give to thee intelligence&rsquo;: 530 He touches the (son&rsquo;s ) two shoulders ( with the mantra ) be a etone, be an axe, be indestructible gold; thou art indeed Veda, called son; so live a hundred autumns&rsquo; and (with the mantra ) &lsquo;Oh Indra, bestow the best wealth&rsquo; (Rg. II. 21. 6 ) and &lsquo;Oh Maghavan (bountiful Indra ) | 51 Oh ( Indra) partaker of rjisa! bestow on us&rsquo; (R&amp;. III. 36. 10). And let them give him a name&rdquo;, The following sūtras ( I. 15. 5-10) lay down rules about the name, which will be considered under Nāmakarana,</p>

<li>The verse is zo bided because it was deemed to produce intelligence,</li>

<p>. 580. Narayana (on Aśv. gr. I. 15. 2) notes that some say that the mantra is muttered only once, when the mouth is brought near each car one after another, others say that the mantra is recited twice.</p>

Nardyapa profors this last because the blooyakara who went before did so.</li>

<p>It will be noticed that out of the several co.oponents of the rite described in the Br. Up. and the Sat. Br., Asv. omits express mention of homa, of putting the child to the breast (stanadāna), the address to the mother (mātrabhimantrana ), and the brea thing over the child by five brāhmaṇas or the father. The Sān. gr. (I. 24. 1-12 ) also omits homa, the stanadāna and mātrabhi. mantrana, but refers to the father breathing over the new born child thrice. Instead of ghṛta and honey served with a golden spoon, Sān. prescribes mixing of ourds, honey, ghṛta and water or grinding together of rice and barley. It adds the tying of gold to &amp; hempen string and fixing it on the right hand of the child till the mother gets up from child-bed.</p>
<p>It will have been noticed that Aśv. and San. both prescribe giving a secret name to the child on the day of birth and do not prescribe a separate Nāmakaraṇa ceremony. Śān. gr. (1. 24. 6 ) adds that a vyāvahārika name inay be given on the 10th day from birth. The Gobhila gr. (II. 7. 13-15 ) and Khādira gr. II. 2. 28-31 say that a secret name for the child that is to be born is to be uttered in the Sosyanti-karma. 80 Āśv, probably carries on that tradition.</p>
<p>We shall now take the several components of the rite and show how they are dealt with by the several grhyasūtras.</p>
<p>Homa :-This is prescribed by the Br. Up., the Manava, the Kathaka gf. at the time of birth. The Asv. gr. pariśiṣṭa (1.26) says that home should be performed to Agni and other gods as stated above, then the child should be made to eat honey and gbpta and then the offering be made to Agni. It is prescribed before birth ( in the Sosyantikarma) by Gobhila and Khādira. It is prescribed after the whole rite by Baud. gr. II. 1. 13. It is omitted by Asy.and San, The Pār. gs. (1. 16), Hir. gr., Bharadvāja gr. (I. 26 ) say that the Aupāgana (i. e. gļhya ) fire is taken away and a sūtikāgni set up (which is also called Uttepaniya )532 near the door of the lying-in chamber. The Vaik. (III. 15 ) calls it jātakāgni (and also Uttapaniya ). These say that in this fire white mustard seed with small grains of rice are offered at the time of birth and at the morning and evening twilights for ten days after birth with certain mantras. Ap. proboribes that</p>

<p>Sanskūras-Jatakarma</p>
<p>mustard seeds and rice chaff are to be offered in the fire when. ever any body enters the lying-in chanıber for ten days.</p>
<p>(2) Medhājunana -Two meanings are given to tbis. This word does not ocour in the Bṛ, Up. But it speaks of muttering in the right ear of the boy the word &lsquo;vāk&rsquo; thrice and making the boy lick from a golden spoon or ring curds, honey and gbrta. The first of these viz. muttering in the right ear of the boy some words or a mantra is called medhājanana in Āśv. and Śan. (I. 24. 9 which prescribes &lsquo;vāk &lsquo;); while most of the other sūtras viz. Vaik., Hir., Gobhila say that medbājanana is the action of making the child eat honey, ghee, curds or pounded barley and rice, to the acoompaniment of mantras (like * bhūstvayi dadhāmi&rsquo; in Pār. or &lsquo;Bhūr rcaḥ&rsquo; as in Vaikbānasa, or &lsquo;medbām to devaḥ&rsquo;as in Ap.), The Baud. gr. (II. 1. 7) prescribes the giving of ourds, honey and ghșta ten times with each of the ten mantras ( Tai. Br. II. 5. 1) of the anuvāka beginning with &lsquo;prano rakṣati viāvam-ejat.&rsquo; The Vaik, expressly Bays that the Vacā 833 plant, Pathyā plant, gold, honey and clari fied butter become medhājanana. Manu II. 29 seizes upon the making the child eat gold ( dust ), honey and clarified butter to</p>
<p>the accompaniment of mantras as the central part of the rite. Later works like the Samskıramayākha regard this eating of honey and ghfta as the principal part of jātakarma. 534</p>
<p>(3) Ayuṣya Some of the sūtras speak of &amp; rite called Ayuṣya in the jātakarma. This consists in muttering over the navel ( as in Pār.) or in the right ear of the boy some mantra or mantras invoking the bestowal of long life on the boy. Aśv. ( vide p. 231 ) bas such an invocation in conjunction with the eating of honey and gbfta. Bhāradvāja also does the same. Manava gf. prescribes the anuvāka &lsquo;Agne āyur-asi&rsquo; ( Kathaka Sarn. XI. 7) for 21 oblations (this anuvāka is full of the word * 2yuṣmat&rsquo;).</p>
<p>(4) Amsābhimarsana ( touching the child on the shoulder or shoulders ). Vide Asv. above. Ap. begins his treatment with the direction that the father touches the boy with the Vatsapra anuvāka. Pār., Bhāradvāja speak of touching the boy twioe, once with Vātsapra anuvāka (Vāj. 8. XII. 18-29 or Tai, S. IV.</p>

<p>2.2), and again with be a stone, be an axe&rsquo;(in Par. and with the mantra &lsquo;may he grow&rsquo; in Bhār.). Some sūtras like Saó. omit this.</p>
<p>(5) Matrabhimantrana :-( addressing the mother). The mother is addressed by the father with the verse. Thou art Iļa &amp;o&rsquo; ( vide Bļ. Up, above), which occurs in Pār. Many sutras ounit this. Hir. has a different verse.</p>
<p>(6) Panoa-brāhmaṇasthāpana :-We saw above that the Satapatha prescribes the breathing over the child by five brāh manas or the father himself. Pār. prescribes the same and gives an option (the five brāhmanas are to repeat in order from the east prāṇa, vyāna, apāna, udāna and samāna ). Sān. asks the father bimself to breathe thrice over the boy with a verse referring to the three Vedas. Several sūtras omit this.</p>
<p>(7) Stana-pratidhāna or stanapradana:-making the child take the breast. The Br. Up. and many of the sūtras prescribe this, together with the recitation of a mantra or mantras e. g. Pār, prescribes Vāj. S. 17. 87 and 38.5 for the two breasts, Ap. and Bhār. prescribe Ap. mantrapatha II. 13. 2 only for the right breast ; Hir. and Vaik. prescribe the same verse for both.</p>
<p>(8) Desābhimantraña385 (or-marśana);touching the ground where the son is born and addressing the earth ( with one or two mantras ). Pār., Bhār., Ap., Hir. do this.</p>
<p>(9) Namakarana :-(giving a name to the child ). The Bṛ. Up., Āgv., Sān., Gobhila, Khadirs and several others speak of giving a name to the boy on the day of birth. Aśv. (I. 15. 4 and 10 ) presoribes the giving of two names on that date, one for common use (for which he gives elaborate rules) and the other a secret one which his parents only know till the boy&rsquo;s upanayang. San. reverses this and says the name for which similar elaborate rules are laid down by him is the secret name and a name for common use is to be given on the 10th day, Ap. gr. ( 15.2-3 and 8 ) says on the day of birth a name derived from the nakṣatra (lunar mansion) on which the boy is born is given, which is the secret name and then on the 10th another pame is to be given. According to Gobhila and Khādira a name is to be given in the Sosyanti-karma which is to be kept secret.</p>

<p>(10) Keeping off evil spirits :&ndash;Though Aøv. and san are entirely silent on this point several sutras devote large space to this topic and are full of mantras which are more are less magio. Ap. presoribes the offering of mustard seed and rice chaff in fire three times with each of eight mantras (Ap. pantra pātha II. 13. 7-14). Bhār. gr. (I. 23 ) also prescribes similar offerings with several verses. Hir. gr. requires the throwing of mustard seeds eleven times in the sūtikāgne with eleven mantras some of which are almost the same as in Bhāradrāja. Pār. gr. recites two of such mantras.528</p>
<p>It would not be out of place to mention a few other subsidiary matters. Baud., Ap., Hir. and Vaik. expressly say that the boy is to have a bath. The Hir, and Vaik, 537 say that the axe is to be placed on a stone and gold is to be placed on the axe, then these are to be turned upside down ( so that gold lies at the bottom and the stone is on top ) and then the boy is to be held head eastwards above the stone by a female in her two hands, while the father repeats the two mantras &quot; be a stone &amp;c.&rsquo; and the mantra &rsquo;thou art produced from (my) limb by limb &amp;o.&rsquo; This shows how what was once only symbolical (viz. uttering the mantras &quot; be a stone&rsquo; &amp;c. indicating the desire that the boy should be strong, sharp and worthy like a stone, axe and gold ) became transformed into &amp; rite requiring physical presence of these things. Par.. Ap., Hir., Bbār. and Vaik. prescribe that a pot full of water should be placed towards the head ( of the woman and her child) with a mantra &lsquo;Oh waters!</p>

<p>ETT SETT Ap. M. P. II. 11, 33. Ap. 97. (15.12) presoribes that when a father returns from a journey he should take in his hands his son&rsquo;s head, should smell (or kiss ) the top of it thrice and then mutter this verse. Nir. III. 4. quotes this verse as a rk in support of the view that sons and daughters equally partake of the inheritance. The formula EAT 7 ooours in Adv. gr. and in others also. Vaik. says that the jar ia to be to the south of the woman&rsquo;s head ; Āp. employs the word &lsquo;kirastaṇ&rsquo; which Sudardanı oxplains a.. near the head of the ohild&rsquo;.

<p>watch while (people are asleep). None of the sotras ( except Vaikhānasa ) refers to any astrological details. Vaik. (III. 14 ) gays that when the child&rsquo;s nose appears, the position of the planets should be observed and his future welfare or otherwise should be examined, since the boy is to be so brought up as to enhance his good qualities. Both Āp, and Baud, say that the remnants of honey, curds and ghrta should be mixed with water and poured out in a cowstable (and not thrown about in an impure place ). This ceremony is comparatively brief in Ap., Sān. and a few others, but in Hir., Par, and Bhāradvāja it is most elaborate and would require an unduly long time consi dering the state of the newly born child and the woman in child-bed. There is no wonder, therefore, that this ceremony gradually went out of vogue.. In modern times a few well-to-do families in Western India sometimes perform what is called &lsquo;putrāvana&rsquo; (in Marathi) and make the boy lick honey and ghfta by means of a golden piece or ring. The dangers to the child of an elaborate ritual must have been apparent to all people even in ancient times. 588</p>
<p>The Sm. O. (I. p. 19 )539 cites Hārita, Saṅkha, Jaimini to the effect that till the navel cord is out there is no impurity, that the saṁskāra may be performed till then and that gifts of jaggery, sesame, gold, clothes, cows and corn may be made and accepted. The same work quotes Samyarta and other smṛtis to the effect that the father must bathe before he can perform the jātakarma rite. This would involve some further loss of time and it is remarkable that the grhy&amp; sūtras observe silence about this, though Manu V. 77 prescribes a bath on hearing of the birth of a son, The Sm. C. quotes Pracetas, Vyāsa and others to the effect that a nāndiśrāddha ( whioh will be explained under srāddha ) should be performed in jātakarma ( brāhmanas are not to eat cooked food in this srāddha, but to receive corn or only money payment). Later works like the Dharmasindhu say that in jātakarma as in other rights, svastivāoana, punyābą. vācana and mātrkāpūjana are necessary.</p>

<p>Medieval writers of digests give extensive descriptions of sānti rites 540 performed to counteract the inauspiolous effoots of birth on the 14th tithi of the dark half of a month or on the amāvāsya or on Mūla, Asleṣā and Jyeṣthā nakṣatras and certain astrological conjunctions like Vyatipāta, Vaidhfti, Sarnkranti (sun&rsquo;s passage from one sign of the zodiac into another). These matters are passed over here for want of space, as of little importance in modern times and as new departures introduced in the ancient sutra rites by later works. A few general remarks will be made on these matters in the section on Śanti and Muhurta.</p>
<p>In modern times on the 5th and 6th days after birth certain ceremonies are performed for which there is no warrant in the sūtras. These probably arose in the times of the Puranas, sinoe the only verses quoted on this point in the Nirnayasindhu, the Samskāramayukha and other works are the Mārkandeyapurāṇa, Vyāsa and Nārada. On these days the father or other male relative bathes in the first part of the nigbt, then invokes Ganesa, and certain minor deities called Janmadā on handfuls of rice and also Ṣaṣthidevi and Bhagavati ( i. e. Durgā) and worships them with sixteen upacāras. Then tāmbia and dakṣinā are offered to one or more brāhmaṇas and the members of the family keep awake that night with songs (in order to ward off evil spirits). One text from the Mārkandeyapurāns Bays&rsquo;men fully armed should keep watch the whole night&rsquo;. It must be noted here that fear springing from astrological considerations got bettor of even natural love and affection to such an extent that some writers advised that the child when born on certain inauspicious conjunctions should be abandoned and its face should not be seen till at least its eighth year, Vide Nityacārapaddbati pp. 244-255.</p>
<p>Utthana getting up from child-bed). According to Vaik, III. 18 on the 10th or 12th day after birth, the father shaves, bathes, purifies the house, performs in the jātakāgni ( or in the ordinary fire, according to some) a sacrifice to the earth through some person belonging to another gotra. Then he brings back the aupāgana (gṛbya fire), offers oblations to Dhāts and others (as in l. 16), five oblations to Varuna (I. 17), the mūlahoma (I. 18 ) and feeds the brahmanas. San. gs. (I, 25 ) is more elaborate. It pre scribes that a mess of cooked food is prepared in the sūtikagni</p>

<p>There is great divergence of view as to the time when the ohild was named. Several times are suggested in the ancient literature and in the sūtras and smrtis.</p>
<p>(a) We have already seen (p. 232 ) that a child was addressed by a name, according to Gobhila and Khādira, even in the Sosyantikarma.</p>
<p>(6) According to the Bṛ. Up., Aśv. and Sān., Kathaka gf. (34.1) a name was given to the child on the day of birth. &ldquo;This praotice is supported by a passage of the Sat. Br. Sala therefore when a son is born ( the father ) should bestow on him a name; thereby he drives away the evil that might attach to the boy ; ( the father gives himn) even a second, oven &amp; third ( name)&rsquo;, The Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali appears to refer to this view. &ldquo;In the world the parents give a name to the son when born in a closed space (or room ) such as Devadatta, Yajñadatta; from their employment ( of that name for the boy ) others also come to know this is his appellation&rsquo;&rdquo;. 548</p>

<p>(c) Ap., Baud., Bhar., and Par. prescribe the 10th day after birth for namakarana. The Mabābhāṣya quotes a passag8848 from the Yajnikas that a name was given on a day after the tenth from birth.</p>
<p>(d) Yaj. I. 12 prescribes it on the 11th day after birth.</p>
<p>(e) Baud. gr. (II. 1. 23 ) says that Namakarana may be performed on the 10th or 12th, while Hir. gr. says that it should be on the 12th. As Vaik. prescribes that the mother should get up from ohild-bed on the 10th or 12th and then speaks of nāmakarana, it follows that the ceremony was performed accord ing to it on the 10th or 12th. Manu 11.30 says it may be performed on the 10th or 12th day after birth or on an auspicious tithi, muhurta and nakṣatra thereafter.</p>
<p>(f) Gobbila (II. 8. 8, S. B. E. vol. 30. p. 57 ) and Khādira 5* say that it should be on any day after ten oights, one hundred nights or a year from birth. Laghu-Aśvaldyana (V1.1) allows it on 11th, 12th or 16th day. Aparārka (p. 26 ) quotes gļhyaparis iṣta to the effect that it may be performed after the 10th night is passed or after 100 nights or a year and the Bhaviṣyat-purana to the effect that it may be performed after 10 or 12 nights or on the 18th day or after a month. It is worthy of note that Bāṇa in his Kadambari ( pūrvabhāga para 68 ) says that Tārāpida named his son Candrāpida when the tenth day after birth fell on an auspicious muhurta and that the minister Sukanāsa named his son Vaiśampāyana next day. 545</p>
<p>The commentators were bewildered by these differences, Viśvarūpe explains Manu II. 30 as &lsquo;when the 10th night is past&rsquo; and Kullūka does the same ( i. e. Bocording to him it is performed on the eleventh day). Medhātithi does not 546 like the addition of &lsquo;past&rsquo; (atitāyām) after &lsquo;dasamyam &rsquo; in Manu II. 30 and says just as jātukarma can be performed even when there is impurity due to birth, so nāmakarana may be performed on the 10th and that the only essential thing is that it is not to</p>

<p>be performed before the 10th or 12th. Aparārka says that there is an option and one may follow one&rsquo;s own grhyasūtra. It appears that the nāmakarana 547 of Hariscandra, son of Jayat candra, king of Kanoj, took place three weeks after jātakarma (on 31. 8. 1175 A. D.). In modern times nāmakaraña generally takes place on the 12th day after birth and no Vedic ceremony as prescribed in the sūtras is gone through, but women assemble and after consulting the male members of the family beforeband announce the name and place the child in the oradle.</p>
<p>In Rg. VIII. 80. 9 we read &lsquo;when you give us a fourth name connected with (the performance of ) a sacrifice, we long for it; immediately afterwards, you, our master, take us &lsquo;(for ward to glory ) 54% This shows that a man could have a fourth name even in the times of Rg. and the fourth was a name due to the performance of a yajña. Sāyaṇa explains that the four names are: nakṣatranāma ( derived from the nakṣatra on which a person was born ), a secret name, &amp; publicly known name and a fourth name like Sumayāji (due to having performed a Somayāga ). In Ry. X. 54. 4 there appears to be a reference to four names (though Sāyana takes nāma here to mean thaven</p>
<p>tra, even or deed). In Rg. IX. 75. 2 there is reference to a la</p>
<p>the son has a third name unknown to the parents and the in the bright part of heaven&rsquo;. The two names are the mostra name and the ordinary name, while the third would be the name due to the performance of a sacrifice (which the parents could not foresee at his birth). In the Rg. frequent reference is made to the secret name of a person. Vide Rg. IX 87. 3, X. 55. 1-2. We saw above ( note 541a ) that the Sat. Br. speaks of a second or even a third name for a person given to him by his parents. The same Brāhmaṇa 5*recommends &ldquo;Therefore a brāhmaps</p>

<p>when he does not prosper should give himself &amp; second name&rsquo;. But how these names were formed is not stated anywhere in the Vedic literature. In the Tai. S. VI. 3. 1.3 it is said therefore a brābmaṇa who has two names prospers &lsquo;. $50 The Sat. Br. (II. 1. 2. 11 ) gays Arjuna is the secret name of Indra and the constellation of Phālgūuis being presided over by Indra they are really Arjunyaḥ, but are called Phālgunyaḥ in an indirect way:55? We saw above (p. 230) that the Bļ, Up. speaks of a secret name given by the father on the day of birth. Hardly apy secret names are expressly mentioned in the Vedic literature except the name of Arjuna given to Indra (and being secret they cannot be expected to be mentioned). How the secret name was given is not clear from the Vedic literature. In Vāj. 8. 17. 89 there is a reference to the secret name of ghrta 568 The Tal. 8. gives expression to the request that the (dhavaniya); fire should bear the name of one who keeps sacred fires, while the person</p>
<p>praying was away on a journey &ldquo;63.</p>
<p>A few examples of the three names of a person from the Vedic literature may be given here. These are generally the ordinary name, a name derived from his father and a third from his gotra ( or from the name of some remote ancestor). In Rg. V. 33. 8 we find Trasadasyu ( his own name), Paurukutsya ( son of Purukutsa), Gairikṣita (descendant of Girikṣita ). In the Ait. Br. ( 33.5) Sunah epa is spoken of as Ajigarti ( son of AjIgarta ) and also as Angirasa (a gotra name ), while king Harigoandra is mentioned ( Ait. Br. 33, 1 ) as Vaidhasa ( son of Vedhas ) and Aikṣvāka ( descendant of Ikṣvāku ). In the Sat. Br. (XIII.5.4.1) Indrota Daivāpa ( son of Devāpi) Saunaka (&amp; gotra name) is said to have been the priest of Janamejaya. In the Chan. Up.(V. 3. 1 and 7) Svetaketu Aruneya (son of Aruni) is styled Gautama (a gotre name). In the Kathopaniṣad</p>

<p>Usually however a person is referred to in the Vedic literature by two names. In some cases it is his own name and a gotra nane 0. g. Medbyātithi Kāṇva (Rg. VIII. 2. 40), Hiranyastūpa Angirasa (Rg. X. 149.5), Vatsapri Bhālandana (Tai. 8. V. %. 1. 6), Bālāki Gārgya ( Bṛ. Up. II. 1.1), Cyavana Bhārgava ( Ait. Br. 39.7). In other cases &amp; man is referred to by his own name and another name derived from a country or locality e. g. Kasu Caidya (Rg. VIII.5.37), Bhima Vaidarbha ( Ait. Br. 35. 8), Durmukha Pañcala ( Ait. Br. 39. 23), Janaka Vaideha ( Br. Up. III. 1. 1), Ajātasatru Kābya (Br. Up. II. 1. 1), In some cases a matronymio is added to a person&rsquo;s name e. g. Dirgbatamā Māmateya (Rg. I. 158. 6), Kutga Arjuneya ( son of Arjuni, Rg. IV. 26. 1, VII, 19. %, VIII. 1. 11 ), Kaksivat Ausija (son of a woman called Usik, Rg. I. 18. 1, Vāj. S. III. 28 ),*** Prahlada Kāyādbava (son of Kayādhū, Tai. Br. I. 5. 10), Mahidāsa Aitareya ( son of Itarā, Chān. Up. III. 16.7). In the vamsa added at the end of the Br. Up. there are about forty sages with matronymio names. The practice of mentioning &amp; man by reference to his mother&rsquo;s name or to his mother&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s gotra was continued till later times, as will be shown later on. The most usual method, however, of referring to a person in the Rg. and also in other Vedic works was to state his name along with another derived from his father&rsquo;s, name. For example, Ambariṣa, Rjrāśva, Sahadeva and Surādhas are all called Vārṣāgira ( son of Vrṣagir, Rg. I. 100. 17 ); king Sudās is called Paijavana ( son of Pijavana, Rg. VII. 18. 22), Deyāpi is Arṣtiṣena ( son of Rṣtiṣena, Rg. X. 98. 5-6), Samyu Bārhaspatya (Tai. 8. II. 6. 10), Burgu Vāruṇi (Ait. Bṛ, 13. 10 and Tai. Up. III. 1), Bharata Dauṣṣanti (Satapatha XIII. 5. 4. 11, Ait. Bṛ, 39. 9), Nābhānediṣtha Mānava ( Ait. Br. 22, 9).</p>
<p>The principal rules about names may now be set out from the gphyasūtrag. Asv. ( I. 15. 4-10, S. B, E. vol. 29, pp. 182-183 ) Bays &lsquo;Let (them) give the boy a name beginning with a sonant, having a semivowel in it, with a visarga at the end, consisting of two syllables or of four syllables, of two syllables if (the father) is desirous of firm (worldly ) position ( for his son ), of four syllables if he is desirous of spiritual eminence (for his son );</p>

<p>and all the</p>

<p>Sanskaras-Namakarana</p>
<p>245</p>
<p>but (in all cases ) with an even number of syllables in the case of males and with an uneven number of syllables in the case of women. And let him find out (for the boy ) a name to be employed at respectful salutations ( at Upanayana &amp;c.); that name ( the boy&rsquo;s ) mother and father alone should know till his upanayana &ldquo;555. The Sān. gr. (S. B. E. vol. 29. p. 50) omits the rule about the name ending in a visarga and allows an option of six syllables and adds that the name should be formed by a kft affix ( from a root) and not by a taddhita; that this name should be known only to his parents and that on the tenth day after birth the father should give the child a name for ordinary use which should be pleasing to brāhmaṇas. It should be noticed that Asy, and Sān. differ on one very important point. According to AŚy, the name for which elaborate rules are laid down is to be the ordinary name and he lays down no rule about the forma. tion of the secret name; while Sān. lays down for the secret name the same rules as Asy, does for the public one and San. Bays about the public name that it should be pleasing.</p>
<p>Instead of quoting gļhya sūtras at length the principal rules about names deducible from them may be stated in the form of propositions with a few illustrations for each.</p>
<p>(1) The first rule in almost all sūtras is that the name for males should contain two or four syllables or an even number. This rule is deduced from Vedic literature where most of the names contain either two syllables (e. g. Baka, Trita, Kutsa, Bhṛgu) or four syllables (Trasadasyu, Purukutsa, Medhyatithi, Brahmadatta &amp;c.), though names of three bylla. bles (like Kavaṣa, Cyavana, Bharata ) and of five syllables</p>

<p>(Ch. VI</p>
<p>(like Nābhānediṣtha, Hiranyastupa ) are not wanting. Baija vāpass grhya allowed the name to be of one, two, three, four or any number of syllables. Sān, allowed a name even of six syllables and Baud. gr. ( II. 1. 25 ) of six or even eight. Exam ples of names with two syllables and four syllables are given below.</p>
<p>(2) Almost all gphyą sutras contain the rule that the name should begin with a sonant and contain in the middle a semitowel. This is stated also in the ancient quotation from Yājõikas in the Mahābhāṣya.</p>
<p>(3) Some sūtras prescribe that the name should end in a visarga preceded 557 by a long vowel (e. g. Ap., Bhār., Hir., Pār.). Āśv. only mentions that it should end in a visarga, while Vaik. and Gobhila say that it may end in a long vowel or in a visarga.</p>
<p>These rules were probably based on such Vedic names as Sudās, Dirghatamas, Pștbusrayas ( that occur in the Rgveda ) and such names as Vatsapri ( Tai, S. V. 2. 1. 6).</p>
<p>(4) Ap. prescribes that the name should have two parts, the first being a noun and the second a verbal formation ( generally a past passive participle). This rule is probably based on such ancient names as Brabmadatta ( wbich occurs in Bṛ. Up. I. 3. 24 and figures very much in Pali works ), Devadatta, Yajñadatta &amp;c.</p>
<p>(5) Many grbya sūtras (like Pār., Gobhila, san., Baija vāpa, Vārāba ) say that the name should be formed from a root by a kft affix and should not be a taddhita (i, e. formed from a noun by an affix ).</p>
<p>(6) Ap. and Hir, say that the name should have the upasarga&rsquo;su&rsquo; in it as a Brāhmana passage says that such a name has stability in it. Examples are Sujata, Sudarsana, Sukeśas ( Praśna Up. I. 1).</p>

<p>(7) Baud. gr. prescribes that the name may be derived froin a gage or a deity or an ancestor.558 The Mānava grhya, how. ever, forbids the giving of a name of a deity itself, but allows the giving of a name derived from the name of a deity or a nakṣa tra. Examples of names derived from sages would be Vāsistba, Nārada &amp;o, and of names taken from deities would be Viṣṇu, Śiva &amp;o. The Mit, on Yāj. I. 12 quotes a passage of Sarkha that the name should be connected with one&rsquo;s family deity. It should be noticed that in modern times most names in many parts of India are the names of deities or of heroes supposed to be avatāras of deities. In Vedic literature hardly any human being bears the name of any of the Vedic gods (Indra, Mitra, Pūṣan &amp;c). There are only a few exceptions such as that of Bbrgu ( in Tai. Up. III. 1 ) who is said to have learnt from his father called Varuna and in the Praśna Up. (I. 1) there is Sauryāyaṇi Gārgya whose name is derived from Sūrya. But in the Vedic Literature persons have names derived from the names of gods, such as Indrota ( Indra +ūta, protected ), Indradyumna. The names that occur in the Mahābhāṣya such as Devadatta, Yajñadatta, Vāyudatta (vol. II. p. 296 ), Viṣṇumitra ( vol. I. pp. 41 and 359), Bphaspatidattaka (or Bphaspatika ), Prajāpati. dattaka (or-patika), Bhanudattaka (or Bhānuka) and others set out in the Mahābhāṣya ( vol. II. p. 425 ) exemplify the rule of the Mānavagrhya. It is difficult to say when the very names of deities began generally to be borne by human beings. Probably the practice began in the first centuries of the Christian era. From the fifth century onwards we have historio examples of such names, 6. g. in the Eran stone inscriptions of Budha gupta dated in the Gupta samvat 165 i. e. 484-5 A, D, (Gupta Inscriptions No. 19 ) there is a brāhmaṇa Indra-Viṣṇu, son of Varuṇa-Viṣṇu, son of Hari-Viṣṇu.</p>
<p>(8) Baud., Pār., Gobhila (and the Yājñikas quoted by the Mahābhāṣya ) prescribe that the name of the boy may be the same as that of any of the ancestors of the father. The Mānava gr. (I, 18 ) expressly says that the father&rsquo;s own name should not be given. This practice was observed in ancient times and continues even today, when the child is often given his grand father&rsquo;s name,559 Vide I. A. vol. VI. p. 73 where we see that Pulakesi II was grandson of Pulakesi I.</p>

<p>(9) The gļhyasūtras (except Pār. and Manava) are agreed that &amp; secret name is to be given to the boy by the parents, in the Sosyantikarma according to Gobhila and Khadira, at birth accord ing to some (like Aśv. and Kathaka) and according to others like Āp., Baud., Bhār.) at the time of Nāmakarana on 10th or 12th day. We saw above that Sān. and Kathaka give elaborate rules about the secret name, which rules are those of the Vyavahā. rika 580 name according to Aśv, and many other sūtrakāras. Gobhila and Khādira give no rules about the secret name. Ap., Hir. and Vaik, only say that the secret name should be derived from the nakṣatra of birth, but give no further rules. Bhāra dvāja 58&rsquo; speaks of the giving of two names in Nāmakarana, one being derived by applying the intricate rules described above and the other being a nakṣatra name; but it is not quite clear which was to be the secret&rsquo; name; it is probable, however, that the nakṣatra name was to be the secret one. According to A$va lāyana the secret name was called Abhivādaniya ( which was to be known to the parents only till the boy&rsquo;s upanayana and which was to be used by the boy for announcing bimself in respectful salutations ); but he does not say how it was to be derived. Gobhila, Khādira, Vārāha (5) and Mānava speak of an abhivadanlya name. Gobhila prescribes that this name was to be given to the boy at the time of upanayana by the ācārya and was to be derived from the naksatre of birth or from the presiding deity of that Dakṣatra. Gobhila 568 further adds that accord ing to some teachers the abbivādaniya name was derived from</p>

According to them a name like greit would be the fourth name. In वैखानस I. 7 it is said that in the पुण्याहवाचन the following names of the 4F791H should be taken one after another viz.

<p>the gotra of the boy (ase.g. Gargya, Sandilya, Gautama &amp;c.). This practice is based on the usage we find in the Upaniṣads, where Satyakāma when about to go to &amp; teacher for Vedic study asks his mother what his gotra was (Chan, Up. IV.4.1) and where the teacher also asks him what his gotra was. In the Kathopaniṣad Naciketas is styled Gautama and in Chān. V. 3.7 Svetaketu is addressed as Gautama by Pravābana Jaivali when the latter expounded Samvarga-vidyā to the former. But if the abhivādaniya was a gotra name there could have been no secrecy. From Gobhila it appears that the ācārya told the boy his abhivadaniya name, but the Khadira suggests that the boy already knew it ( from his father or mother) and informed the toacher. The nakṣatranāma was of importance in the perform. ance of Vedic sacrifices. The Vedangajyotisa 563 (of the Rg) in verses 25-28 enumerates 28 nakṣatras ( adding Abhijit after Uttarāṣāḍhā and before Śravaṇa) and their presiding deities and adds that in sacrifices the sacrificer is to bear a name derived from the name of the presiding deity of his nakṣatre. The object of keeping the nakṣatra name secret seems to have been to prevent rites of abhicāra (magical practices ) against &amp;</p>

<p>Hundreds of names oocur in the Vedic Literature, but there are hardly any names directly derived from &amp; nakṣatra. In the Sata patha (VI. 2. 1. 37 ) there is an Aṣādhi Sausromateya (son of Aṣadha and Susromata ). Here Aṣāḍha is probably connected with the nakṣatra Aṣadha. It appears therefore that in the times of the brahmanas pakṣatra names were secret and 80 are not met with. Gradually however nakṣatra names ceased to be secret and became common. For several centuries before the Christian era nakṣatra names were very common. Pāṇini (who cannot be placed later than 300 B. C. and may have flourished some centuries earlier still) gives several rules (IV. 3. 34-37 and VII. 3. 18) for deriving names of males and females from nakṣatras. In IV, 3. 34 he says that names are derived from Śraviṣthā, Phālguni, Anuradha, Svāti, Tiṣya, Punarvasu, Hasta, Aṣāḍha and Babula (Kșttikā) without adding any termination signifying &lsquo;born on&rsquo; (e. g. we have the names Sraviṣthaḥ, Phālgunaḥ &amp;c.). In VII.3.18 he derives the name Proṣthapadaḥ from Prosthapadā. In the Junagadh inscription of Rudradāman (150 A. D.) the brother-in-law of Candragupta Maurya is said to have been a vaisya named Puṣyagupta ( E. I. vol. VIIL. P. 43). This shows that in the 4th century B. O. &amp; name was derived from the nakṣatra Puṣya (80 the name was nakṣatrāśraya ). The Mahābhāṣya (vol. I. p. 231 ) speaks of boys named Tisya and Punarvasu and cites Citrā, Revati, Rohiṇī as names of women born on these nakṣatras (vol. II. p. 307 ) and of Caitra as &amp; male (vol. II. p. 128 ). The Mahābhāṣya speaks of Puṣyamitra, the founder of the Śunga dynasty ( vol. I. p. 177, vol. II, pp. 34 and 123 ). Buddhists also had nakṣatra names 8. 8. Moggaliputta Tissa ( where &amp; gotra name and a nakṣatra name from Tiṣya are combined), a parivrājaka Potthapāda in Digha I. p. 187 and III. p. 1 (from the nakṣatra Proṣthapada ), Asāda, Phaguna, Svātiguta, Pusara khita and in the Sāñci inscriptions of 3rd century B. C. (E. I. ( vol. II. p. 95). The giving of nakgatra names continued for centuries after the Christian era. For example, in the Palitana plate of Dhruvagona I dated Valabhi samvat 210 (about 529 A. D.) there is a brāhmana named Viśākha. We have</p>

<p>names like Puṣyasyāmi, Rohinisyāmi ( in the plates of Śivarāja dated 602-3 A. D., in E. I. vol. IX. p. 288 ). Another way of deriving names from nakṣatras was to form them from the presiding deity of the nakṣatra on which a person was born. A man was called Agneya, if he was born on Kfttikā ( Agni being its devatā), Maitra (from being born on Anuradha ). In modern times this round-about way is given up and persons are named directly from the names of gods and avatāras (like Rāma).</p>
<p>There is another way of deriving names from nakṣatras set forth in medieval works on Dharmaśāstra and Jyotiṣa. Each of the 27 nakṣatras is divided into four pādas and to each pāda a specifio letter is assigned (e. g., cũ, ce, co and la for the pādas of Aspini) from which names are derived for persons born in those pādas (e. g. Cūdāmaṇi, Cedisa, Colesa and Lakṣmaṇa for the four pādas of Asyini ).Sos These names are secret and are even now muttered into the ear of the brahmaoārl in Upa na. yana and are known as the name in the dāily samdhyā prayer.</p>
<p>Modern works like the Samskāraprakāsa (p. 237 ) say that four kinds of names may be given viz. devatānāma, māsanāma, nakṣatranāma and vyāvahārikanāma. The first shows that the bearer is the devotee of that devatā. The Nirnayasindhu 566 quotes &amp; verse about twelve names derived from the month in which a man was born and adds that the Madanaratna laid down that the names specified in the verse were to be given to the months from Margaśirṣa or Caitra. Such names of Viṣṇu ) are being given now, particularly in Western India, but without regard to the month of birth. So early as in the Bșhatsambitā of</p>

<p>As to the names of girls, some special rules were laid down. Many grbyasūtras say that the names of girls should contain an uneven number of syllables and the Mānava gr. (I. 18 ) expressly says that the names of girls should be of three sylla bles. Pār. and Vārābagrhya further say that the names of girls should end in &lsquo;a&rsquo;, Gobhila and Mānava say they should end in &lsquo;da&rsquo; (as in Satyadā, Vasuda, Yasodā, Narmadā), Saṅkha-likhita dharmasutra and Baijayāpa require that it should end in &rsquo;l&rsquo;, while the Baud.588 gr. sesa-sutra says that it should end in a long vowel. The Vārāhagļhya adds an intricate rule that the name of a girl should have an &lsquo;a&rsquo; vowel in it and should not be after a river, a nakṣatra or should not be the name of the gun or moon or Pūṣan and should not be one having the idea of &lsquo;given by god&rsquo; as in Devadattā or having the word &lsquo;rakṣitā ( as in Buddharakṣitā ).569 Manu II. 33 prescribes that the names of women should end in a long vowel, should be easy to pronounce, should not suggest any harsh acts, should be perspicuous, should be pleasing to the ear, auspicious and should convey some bles sing and in III. 9 Manu and Ap. gr. III. 13 say that one should not marry a girl named after nakṣatras, trees, rivers. In modern times girls frequently bear the names of the great rivers of India ( Sindhu, Jāhnavi, Yamunā, Tāpi, Narmada, Goda, Krṣṇā, Kāveri &amp;c. ). .</p>
<p>It is remarkable that Manu altogether omits the involved rules given by the gṛhya sūtras about naming a boy and prescri bes ( II. 31-32 ) two simple rules viz. that the names of all the members of the four varṇas should suggest respectively suspici ousness, vigour, wealth and lowness (or contempt) and that the names of brāhmaṇas and the other varṇas should have an addition ( upapada ) suggestive of sarman (happiness ), rakṣa</p>

<p>(proteotion ), puṣti ( prosperity ) and preṣya (service or depen dence on others ). It is significant that none of the gļhya sūtras except Pāraskara 570 makes any reference to these additions ( śarman and the like) to the names of brāhmaṇas and others. Therefore this was comparatively &amp; later development, though such additions must have been in vogue at least two centuries before the Christian era. The Mahābhāgya s71 ( vol. III. P. 416 ) cites Indravarman and Indrapālita as the names of a rājanya and a vaisya. Yama quoted by Aparārka (p. 27 ) says 574 that the names of brāhmaṇas should have the addition of sarma or deva, of kṣatriyas varma or trūta, of vaisyas bhūti or datta, and of sūdras dāsa. Similar rules are given in the Purāṇas $73. These rules were sometime observed, but were often broken from very ancient times as inscriptions show. A striking example of the observance of these rules is contained in the Talgunda Inscription of Kakutsthavarman of the Kadamba family (E. I. vol. VIII. p. 24 ) where the founder who was a brāhmana is styled Mayūraśarman, but his descendants who were kings had names ending in varman ( which was appropriate to ksatriyas). On the other hand we have frequent breaches of these rules. In the Gupta Inscriptions No. 35 (C. I. I. vol. III, p. 150, at p. 156 the Mandasor Ins. of Yasodhar man of Malava year 589, 645-46 A. D.) the genealogy of the brāhmaṇa ministers is Ṣaṣthidatta, his son Varābadāsa, bis son Ravikirti (so the upapadas&rsquo; datta&rsquo; and &lsquo;dāsa&rsquo; appropriate to vaisyas and sūdras respectively were added to brāhmana names ). In the Neulpur plate of Subhakara of Orissa ( 8th century A. D., E. I. vol. XV. p. 4) we have several bhattas whose names and in vardhana, datta and svāmin. In the Nidhanpura plate of Bhāskaravarman (E. I. vol. XIX p. 115 ) among the numerous donees (who must have been all brāhmānas) there are some who are named Srāddhadāsa, Karkadatta and Merudatta.

<p>of the year 60 (C. I. I. vol. II. P. 16 ) his father is called Valavadha (Balavardhana ) and his son Mitravadhana (Mitravardhana ).</p>
<p>A few words may be said about matronymics. A few examples of such names have been given above from Vedic Literature. Aøv. gr.574 (I. 5. 1.) says that in seleoting a bride groom or bride &ldquo;one should first examine the family, as has been already said &rsquo;those who on the mother&rsquo;s and father&rsquo;s side&rsquo;&rdquo;. This refers to the Aśv. Srauta sūtra where it is required that both parents of the brāhmaṇa at the time of camasabhakṣaṇa in Daśapoya should be for ten generations perfect in their learning, austerities, and meritorious works and who can be traced to have throughout been of the brāhmaṇa class on both sides &amp;o. Yāj. I. 54 enjoins that one should choose a girl from</p>
<p>&amp; great family of śrotriyas, which has been famous for ten generations (for learning and character ). Therefore when in certain cases a person is named after his mother or after the gotra of his mother&rsquo;s father, all that is intended to be conveyed is that he is descended from worthy male and female ancestors. There is no question in such cases of matriarchy. In the Nasik Inscription No. 2 (E. I. vol. VIII. p. 60) siri Puļumāyi is des cribed as Vāsithiputa and in E. I. vol. VIII. p. 88 the Abhira king Iśvarasena is described as Mādhariputra. 575 In a Scythian</p>
<p>Inscription ( E. I. vol. X at page 108 ) we have mention of the son of Bhargavi&rsquo;. In all these cases the mother&rsquo;s gotra name is specially emphasized probably to convey that the mothers were of the bluest blood. Comparatively late writers mention the gotra in which their mother was born (e. g. Bhavabhūti who flourished about 700–750 A. D. says that he was a Kāøyapa while his mother was a Jātūkarṇi). From a Kārikā in the Mahābhāṣya we learn that the great grammarian Pāṇini was the son of a Dākṣi. Pāṇini himself 578 (IV. 1. 147 ) delivers a</p>

<p>special rule about the formation of a name for a man from the gotra name of his mother to convey contempt (e. g. Gārgaḥ or Gārgikaḥ, &amp; rogue, from his mother&rsquo;s name Gārgi),579 Sāökha yana gļbya (I. 25.2-9, S. B. E. vol. 29, p. 52 ) prescribes that the father and mother (having bathed themselves and the child) should put on new clothes, that the father should cook a mess of food in the sūtikāgni, that he is to offer oblations to the tithi of the boy&rsquo;s birth and to three constellations with their presiding deities, that he is to place in the middle the oblation to the nakṣatra of birth and he should make two other oblations to fire with two mantras and then the 10th oblation is made to Soma with Rg. I. 91. 7. The father pronounces aloud the child&rsquo;s name and causes the brāhmaṇas to say auspicious words.</p>
<p>The Aśv. gr. does not describe Nāmakarana. Many of the other gļhyasūtras presoribe that the sūtikāgni is to be removed and the home for nāmakarana is to be performed in the Aupāsana ( gļhya) fire, The Bhāradvāja gr. 578 prescribes the repetition of the Jayā, Abhyātāna and Rāṣtrabhṛt mantras and the offering of eight oblations of ghrta with the eight mantras may Dhātr bestow on us wealth&rsquo; (ĀP.M.P. II. 11. 1ff). The Hir. gr. ( II. 4. 6-14, S. B. E. vol. 30 pp. 214–215 ) contains similar rules. It prescribes twelve oblations with the mantras *may Dhāts bestow on us wealth&rsquo; and gives two names &amp; secret naskatra name and an ordinary name) to the boy. The twelve oblations are as follows: four to Dhātr, four to Anu mati, two to Rākā, two to Sinivāli. According to some a thirteenth oblation to Kuhū was to be offered.</p>

<p>Some sūtra works udd &amp; detail immediately after Nāma karana. For example, Asv. gr. ( I. 15. 11 ) says &lsquo;when a father returns from &amp; journey he holds in his hands his son&rsquo;s head, mutters the verse &lsquo;angad angād &amp;c.&rsquo; and thrice smells (kisses) his son on the head. Ap. gr. 15. 12 580 prescribes that on returning from a journey the father should address his son (abbimantraña) with the verse angad,&rsquo; should smell the child on the head with the verge &lsquo;be thou an axe&rsquo; and should mutter in his right ear five mantras. These rules have a very ancient origin. The Kauṣitaki Br. Up. II. 11 says that on returning from a journey the father touches the head of a son with the verse &lsquo;angād-angad &amp;o.&rsquo; and takes the name of the boy and also repeats the verge * aśmā bhava&rsquo; &amp;o. In the case of the girl there is no smelling of the head nor muttering in the ear, but only address ( with a prose formula). This no doubt indicates that greater value was attached to a son than to a daughter, but it also shows that the daughter was not altogether neglected.</p>

<p>gr. (IL.) prescribes a homa with eight oblations. Gobhlla speaks of candradarsana. It says that on the 3rd tithi of the third bright fortnight after birth, the father bathes the child in the morning, worships in the evening the moon with folded hands, then the mother, having dressed the child, hands it with its face to the north from the south to north to the father and herself passes behind the back of the father and stands to the north of him, who worships with the three verses 585 &lsquo;Oh thou whose hair is well parted, thy heart&rsquo; (Mantrabrahmana I. 5. 10–12 ), then the father hands back the son to the mother with the words that this son may not come to harm and be torn from his mother&rsquo;. Then in the following bright fortnights, the father filling his joined hands with water and turning his face towards the moon, lets the water flow out of his joined hands once with the Yajus &lsquo;what is the moon&rsquo; (Mantrabrāhmaṇa I. 5. 13 ) and twice silently. The Khādiragphya bas practically the same rules, except that it does not speak of two times. It will be noted that both omit tbe sight of the sun, but only mention the seeing of the moon. Laghu-Aśvaldyana VII. 1-3 speaks of the performance of abhyudayika sraddha, then reciting the sūkta from svasti no mimitam&rsquo; (Rg. V. 51, 11 ) and &lsquo;āśu siśanaḥ&rsquo; (Rg.

O. remarks that those in whose śākhā this rite is not mentioned need not perform it. The Samskāraprakāśa pp. 250-256 and Sarakararatnamālā pp. 886-888 give an extensive description and make of this samskāra a matter of great pomp, festivity and rejoicing. Yama 588 quoted in Sam, Pr. says that seeing the sun and seeing the moon should be done respectively in the 3rd and 4th months from birth.</p>

<p>month from birth as the time for this samakāra; but Mānava gf. says it may be the 5th or 6th ; while Saṅkha quoted by Aparārka says it should be performed at the end of a year or at the end of six months, according to some 587. The Kathaka gr. enjoins the sixth month from birth or the time when the child first strikes teeth. The procedure is very brief in all except Śān, and Pār, Sān. says that the father should prepare food of goat&rsquo;s flesh, or flesh of partridge, or of fish or boiled rice, if he is desirous of nourishment, holy lustre, swiftness or splendour respectively and mix one of them with ourds, boney and ghee and should give it to the child to eat with the reciting of the Mahāvyābśtis ( bhūḥ, bhuvaḥ, svaḥ). Then the father is to offer oblations to fire with four verses &lsquo;Annapate&rsquo;, 588 Rg. IV. 12. 4-5 and &lsquo;him, Oh Agni, lead to long life and splendour &amp;o&rsquo;. The father recites over the child the verse Rg. IX. 66. 19 and then sets down the child on northward pointed kusa grass with Rg. I. 22. 15. The mother is to eat the remnant of the food thus prepared. Aśv. has almost the same rules as to food (omitting fish ) but prescribes only one verse &lsquo;Annapate&rsquo;. Ap. gr. 589 prescribes feeding of brāhmaṇas, making them give benedictions to the child and then making the child eat only once amess of curds, honey, ghee and boiled rice mixed together, with the recitation of a mantra joined to the three vyābftis singly and collectively and says that according to some the flesh of partridge may also be added. Bhār, says that the method of making a child eat is the same as in Medhājanana and is silent about the food. Pār. gr. (I. 19 ) prescribes the cooking of sthālīpāke and offering the two ajyabhāgas and then two offerings of ghee with the mantras &rsquo;the gods generated 590 the goddess of speech &amp;o &lsquo;(Rg. VIII. 100. 11 ) and the verse &lsquo;may vigour to-day produce for us gifts &amp;c&rsquo;(Vāj. S. 18. 33 ). Mānava, Kathaka and Vaik. are entirely silent about flesh. Kāthaka</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that the principal part of the samskāra is making the child taste food. Some writers add home, feeding of brāhmaṇas, and benedictions. The Samskara prakāśa (pp. 267-279 ) and Samskāraratnamālā (pp. 891-895) have very detailed notes on this samskāra. One interesting matter quoted by Aparārka (p. 28 ) from Mārkandeya is that on the day of this ceremony, in front of the gods worshipped in the house, tools and utensils required in various arts and crafts, weapons and sāstras should be spread about and the child should be allowed to crawl among them and what the child seizes at first should be noted and it should be deemed that he is destined to follow that profession for his livelihood which is represented by the thing first touched by him.</p>
<p>Varṣavardhana or abdapūrti:«In some of the sūtras provi. sion is made for some ceremonies every month on the day of the birth of the child for one year and on every anniversary of the day of birth throughout life. For example, Gobbila gr. ( II. 8. 19-20 ) says every month of the boy&rsquo;s birth for one year or on the parva days of the year he should sacrifice to Agni and Indra, to Heaven and Earth and to the Visve devas. Having sacrificed to these deities be should sacrifice to the tithi and nakṣatra &lsquo;.$02 The Sān. gr. (1. 25. 10-11 S. B, E, vol. 29, p. 52) similarly says&rsquo;having sacrificed in the same way every month on the tithi of the child&rsquo;s birth, he sacrifices when one year has expired in the (ordinary ) domestic fire&rsquo;. Baud. gr. III. 7598 prescribes an offering of cooked rice for life (āyuṣyacaru) &rsquo;every year, every six months, every four months, every season or every month on the nakṣatra of birth&rsquo;.

<p>flesh of a goat and sheep to Agni and Dhanvantari and feeding the brāhmaṇas with food mixed with plenty of ghee. Vaik. III. 20-21 speaks at great length of the ceremony called * Varṣavardhana&rsquo; ( increase of the years of a person) to be performed on the anniversary of the birth-day every year and lays down that in this rite the deity of the nakṣatra on which a child is born is the principal one, that oblations of ghee are to be offered to that deity and nakṣatra and then to the other presiding deities of the nakṣatras and to the nakṣatras them selves, then an oblation with the vyābști (bhūḥ svāhā ), then offerings to Dhātā. It describes in detail how different cere monies are to be performed up to Upanayana, then up to finishing of Veda study, how ceremonies are to be performed on the anniversary day of one&rsquo;s marriage, on the nakṣatra on which a person performed solemn sacrifices like Agnistoma and that if he thus lives till 80 years and 8 months he becomes one who has seen a thousand (full) moons and is called &lsquo;brahma sarfra &lsquo;, in celebration of which several ceremonies are pres cribed ( which for want of space are not set out here ). In connection with the anniversary of the marriage day, 594 Vaik. specially prescribes that whatever ceremonies women direct as done traditionally should be performed. Aparārka (p. 29 ) quotes verses of Mārkandeya to the effect that all should every year on the day of birth celebrate a festival (mahotsava ) in which one should honour and worship one&rsquo;s elders, Agni, gods, Prajāpati, the pitrs, one&rsquo;s nakṣatra of birth and brābmanas, The Kṛtyaratnākara (p. 540 ), the Nitgādārapaddhati (pp. 621-624 ) quote the same verses (as Aparārka does ) and add that on that day one should worship Mārkandeya (who is believed to be immortal) and the seven other cirajivins,595 The Nityācārapaddhati (p. 621 ) quotes a verse that in the case of kings the.anniversary of the day on which they were crowned should be delebrated.

<p>this festival&rdquo; abdapūrti&rsquo;. The Samakāraratananālā contains a very extensive discourse on this rite (pp. 877-886 ) and calls this festival ayurvardhāpena&rsquo;. The Nirnayasindhu and tbe Samskāraratnamālā set out the verses that are addressed to Mārkandeya and others. In modern times women do calobrate overy month the birthday of a child and the first anniversary of birth. They make the child cling to the principal house-post or to the post used for churning out butter from the pail of ourds and water.</p>
<p>Caula or Cudākarma or Cūdakarana :-( the first cutting of the hair on the cbild&rsquo;d head). This samskāra is mentioned by every writer. &lsquo;Cūdā&rsquo; means the &rsquo;lock or tuft of hair kept on the head when the remaining part is shaved (i, e. the sikha ); $0 cūdākarma or cūdākaraṇa means that rite in which a lock of hair is kept ( for the first time after birth ). We get cauda&rsquo; from &lsquo;cūdā &lsquo;586 meaning &lsquo;a rite the purpose of which is keeping a look of hair&rsquo; and &lsquo;da&rsquo; and &rsquo;la&rsquo; often interchange places. So we get&rsquo; cauda &lsquo;or&rsquo;caula&rsquo; also as the name of the ceremony.</p>
<p>According to many 597 writers caula was performed in the third year from birth. Baud. gr. (II. 4), Pār. gr. (II. 1), Manu II. 35, Vaik. III, 23 say that it may be performed in the 1st or 3rd year: Asv. gr. and Vārāba gr. say it may be performed in the 3rd year or in the year in which it is the custom of the faniily to perform it. Pār. also refers to family usage. Yāj. specifies no year, but mentions only family usage. Yama quoted by Aparārka (p. 29 ) allowed it in the first, 2nd or 3rd year, while Saṅkha-Likbita allowed it in the 3rd or 5th ( Aparārka p. 29 ), Ṣad-guru-sisya quoted in the Samskāraprakāśa (p. 296 ) and Nārāyaṇa (on Āśv. gr. I. 17,1) say that some per formed it at the time of upanayana.</p>

<p>Sanskaras-Caula</p>
<p>261</p>
<p>Whether such a ceremony was performed in the Vedic ages cannot be ascertained with certainty. Bhār, gr. I. 28 expressly 5*8 refers to the Vedic verse ( Rg IV. 75. 17 or Tai. S. IV, 6. 4. 5) as indicative of the practice of Caula in Vedic times where arrows fall together like boys having many tufts of hair&rsquo;. Manu II. 35 also has in view this Vedic verse,</p>
<p>The principal act in this ceremony is the cutting of the hair of the obild. The other subsidiary matters are the performance of homa, feeding of brābmaṇas, receiving of their benedictions and giving of dakśiṇā, the disposal of cut hair in such a way that no one can find them.</p>
<p>The ceromony is to be performed on an auspicious day as set out in note 494 above. Ap. gr. 16, 3 says it should be per formed when the moon is in conjunction with Punarvasu nakṣatra, while Mānava gr. says that it should not be done on the 9th tithi of a month. Later works like the Samskāraprakāśa (pp. 299-315 ) give very intricate rules about the auspiciou 8 times, which rules are passed over here. The most exhaustive treatment of this ceremony in the sūtra works is to be found in Aśv., Gobhila, Vārāha 4 and Pār. II. 1.</p>
<p>The materials required in this ceremony are stated as follows:-(1) To the north of the fire are placed four vessels each of which is separately filled with rice, barley, māṣa beans and sesame respectively ( Aśv. gr. I. 17.2 ), but Gobbila (II. 9. 6-7) says that they are to be placed to the east and Gobhila and Sān. say that these are to be given to the barber at the end of the rite ; (2) to the west of the fire the mother with the boy on her lap is to be seated and two vessels one filled with the dung of a bull and the other with sami leaves are to be also placed to the west ( Gobbila II. 9.5 and Khādira II. 3. 18 place the dung to the north of the fire and Khādira says that she sits to the north ); (3) to the right of the mother the father sits holding 21 bunches 599 of kusa grass or the brahmā priest (if there be any) may hold them; (4) warm and cold water or only warm water; (5) an ordinary razor or one made of Udumbara wood ( according to Khādira II. 3. 17 and Gobhila II. 9. 4);(6) a</p>

According to Gobhila and Khādira the barber, hot water, mirror, razor and bunches of kusa grass are to the south of the fire and bull&rsquo;s dung and a mess of rice mixed with sesame are to the north of the fire. Āśv., Pār., Kathaka and Mānava say that the rezor is to be of loha ( which the commentator Nārāyana explains as copper).</p>
<p>After home is performed, the principal matter (of cutting the hair) is to be begun. According to Gobbila and Khādira the father, having contemplated upon Savit;, looks at the barber with the mantra &lsquo;here comes Savitr&rsquo; (Mantra-br. I. 6. 1) and contem plating on Vāyu looks at the warın water with the mantra&rsquo; with warm water, Oh Vāyu, come hither&rsquo;( Mantra-Br. I. 6, 2). The father then mixes the hot and cold water and may put, in a part of the water, butter or drops of curds and apply the water to moisten three times the boy&rsquo;s head with the mantra &lsquo;may Aditi cut thy hair; may the waters moisten ( thy hair) for vigour &lsquo;. Then60d on the right portion of the boy&rsquo;s hair the father puts three kuśa bunches with the points towards the boy with the formula &lsquo;herb, protect him&rsquo; (Tai. 9. I. %. 1. 1). With the words &rsquo; Axe, do not harm him&rsquo; (Tai. S. 1. 2. 1. 1 ) he presses a copper razor (on the kuśa blades). The hair is cut&rsquo; with the mantra &lsquo;with that razor with which Savits, the wise, cut ( the hair ) of king Soma and of Varuna, cut now his (the boy&rsquo;s hair), Oh brābmaṇas, so that he may be endowed with long life and (reach) old age&rsquo;. Each time the hair is cut, he gives the cut hair with their ends turned towards the east together with sami leaves to the mother, who puts them down on the bull dung, Cutting is done a second time with the mantra&rsquo; with what Dhata shaved ( the head) of Bphaspati, Agni and Indra for the</p>

<p>It appears tbat originally the father himself performod tho cutting of the bair. Some of tho gihya sutras like those of Baud, and $&amp;, nowhere mention the barber in this ceremony.

The cutting is done a third time with the mantra &lsquo;with what he may after night ( is past ) see the sun again and again, with that I shave thy (head) for the sake of long life, fame and happiness&rsquo;. The cutting is done for the fourth time with all the three mantras together, Then the hair is out three times on the left side similarly. The edge of the razor is then wiped off with the mantra &lsquo;when thou sbavest as a shaver the hair ( of the boy ) with the razor that wounds and is well-shaped purify his head, but do not deprive him of life&rsquo;. Then he gives orders to the barber &lsquo;doing with lukewarm water what bas to be done with water, arrange his bair ( well ) without causing him (the boy ) any wound&rsquo;. Let him have the hair of the boy arranged according to the custom of the family. The rite only (without the mantras ) is per formed for a girl.eus</p>
<p>According to several sūtras, the cut hair placed in the dung of a bull is buried in a cow stable603 or is thrown in a pond or in the vicinity of water ( Pār., Bhār. ) or is buried at the root of the Udumbara tree ( Bhār.) or in a bunch of darbha grass (Baud.. Bhār., Gobhila ) or in the forest (Gobhila). The Mānava gr. prescribes that as the hair fall down when cut they are gathered by some friendly person. The Kathaka gf. and Mānava gf. say that the barber gets a sesame cake and a fine piece of cloth, while Vaik, says food is given to him. A bath for the boy is expressly prescribed by Baud. and some others.</p>
<p>There is a great divergence of views about the number of locks of hair to be left on the head and the portion of the head where they are to be left.

Ap. gì, says that the locks may in number follow the pravara or they may be kept according to family usage. Gobhila and Khādira say that the locks should be arranged according to gotra and family usage. Whether they mean by &lsquo;gotra&rsquo; the number of pravaras of the gotra or some rule such as the Kathaka gives is not clear. The Kathaka gr. says that the Vāgiṣthas keep a lock on the right, that persons of Atri and Kaśyapa gotra (or pravara ) keep looks both on the right and the left, that the Bhrgus shaves the entire head, that the Angiras gotra keeps five looks or only a line of hair, while persons of other gotras (like Agastya, Viśvāmitra &amp;c.) keep a sikbā (without any particular number of locks ) simply because it is an suspicious sign or one may follow the usage of one&rsquo;s80 family. Vaik.607 says that the locks may be one, two, three, five or seven according to the pravaras. Rgveda 608 VII. 33. 1 refers to the fact that Vasisthas had a look of hair on the right side of the head and so the rule of the Kathaka has a very hoary antiquity behind it. Up to modern times one of the characteri stic outward signs of all Hindus was the sikhā ( the top-knot).

Vasiṣtha (II. 21 ) pres oribes tbat membors of all varṇas (including the sūdra ) should arrange their hair acoording to the fixed usage (of their family) or should shave the whole head except the sikhā, A Vedic passage840 is the head that has no sikhā on it is unholy&rsquo;. For rules about the sikha of students vide later on under upanayana. During recent times men, particularly those receiving English education in towns and cities, are forsaking the ancient practice of keeping a sikbā and follow the western method of allowing the hair to grow on the whole head.</p>
<p>In modern times the rite of cūdākarana generally takes place if at all on the day of Upanayana,</p>
<p>Aśv. gr. (I, 17, 18) expressly says that the ceremony of cūdākarana was to be perforined for girls also, but no Vedic mantras were to be repoated. Manu ( II. 66 ) Bays that all the ceremonies froin jātakarına to caula must be performed at the proper times for girls also in order to purify their bodies but without mantras and Yāj. (1. 13 ) is to the same effect. Even such late writers as Mitramiśra say that the caula of girls may be performed according to the usage of the family and that their bair may be entirely shaved or a siklā may be kept or there should be no shaving at all.911</p>
<p>In some castes even in modern times girls when mere children are shaved once, it being supposed that the first hair are impure.</p>
<p>Vidyārambha :&ndash;The grhya sūtras and dharmasūtras are entirely silent as to what was done for the child&rsquo;s education</p>

<p>between the third year when asually caula was performed and the 8th year (from conception) when the upanayana usually took place ( in the case of brābmanas). They state that rarely upanayana was performed even in the 5th year ( as will be shown hereafter ). Some faint light is thrown on this matter by the Arthasāstra of Kautilya, 81% which says that the prince after the performance of caula is to engage in the study of the alphabet and of arithmetio, and after his upanayana he is to study the Vedas, ūnvikṣiki (metaphysics ), vārlā ( agriculture and the science of wealth ) and dandaniti (the art of government) up till the 16th year when the godāna ceremony is to be performed and after which year ho may marry. Kalidāsa also (in Raghuvamsa III. 28) says that prince Aja first mastered the alphabet and then entered into the ocean of (Sanskrit ) liter ature. Bana has its probably the Arthasāstra in view when he makes prince Candrāpida enter the temple of learning ( vidyā mandira ) at 6 and remain there till he became sixteen and he (like Milton in his letter to Hartlile ) tells us how extensive the ideal curriculum of studies in arts and soiences for the prince was thought to be. In the Uttararamacarita ( Act II) it is said that Kusa and Lata were taught vidyās other than the Veda after their caula and before upanayana.</p>
<p>It appears that at least from the early centuries of the Christian era, &amp; ceremony called Vidyārambha (commencement of learning the alphabet ) was celebrated. Apararka (pp. 30-31) and the Sm.C.(I. p.26)cite verses from the Markandeya-puranasit</p>

<p>Sanskāras-Vidyārambha</p>
<p>267</p>
<p>about vidyārambha as follows: in the fifth year of the child on some day from the 12th of the bright half of Kartika to the 11th of the bright half of Aṣadha, but excluding the 18t, 6th, 8th, 15th tithi or rikta tithis (i. e. 4th, 9th and 14th ) and Saturday and Tuesday, the ceremony of beginning to learn should be performed. Having worshipped Hari ( Viṣṇu ), Lakṣmi, Sarasvati, the sutra writers of one&rsquo;s sākha and the lore peculiar to one&rsquo;s family, one should offer in the fire oblations of olarified butter to the above mentioned deities and should hone our brāhmaṇas by the payment of dakṣiṇā. The teacher should sit facing the east and the boy should face the west and the teacher should begin to teach the first lesson to the boy who should receive the benedictions of brāhmanas. Thereafter teaching should be stopped on the days of anadhyāya (which will be specified later on).</p>
<p>The Samskāra-prakāśa (pp. 321-325 ) and Samskāraratna inālā (pp. 904-907 ) have an extensivo note, a considerable part of which is devoted to astrological matters. The Samskāraprakāśa quotes passages from Viśvāmitra, Devala and other sages and works that vidyārambha is performed in the 5th year or in any case before upanayane. It also quotes a verse from Nṭsimba that Sarasvati and Ganapati should be worshipped and then the teacher should be honoured. The modern practice is to begin learning the alphabet on an auspicious day, generally the 10th of the bright half of Āśvina, Sarasvati and Ganapati are wor shipped, the teacher is honoured and the boy is asked to repeat the words &lsquo;om namah siddham&rsquo; and to write them on a slate and then he is taught the letters (&lsquo;a&rsquo;, &lsquo;a&rsquo; &amp;c.) of the alphabet. The Samskāraratnamālā$15 calls this ceremony Aksarasvikāra (appro priately enough) and among other texts cites a long prose passage from Garga quoted in the Pārijāta and prescribes a homa also with ajyāhutis to Sarasvati, Hari, Lakṣmi, Vighnesa (Ganapati), sūtrakāras and one&rsquo;s vidya,</p>
