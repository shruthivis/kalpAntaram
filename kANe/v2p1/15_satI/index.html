  <p>CHAPTER XV</p>
<p>SATI ( Self-immolation of widows )</p>
<p>The word is often written as &lsquo;suttee&rsquo; in English works and papers. This subject is now of academic interest in India, since for over a hundred years ( i. e. from 1829 ) self-immolation of widows has been prohibited by law in British India and has been deolared to be a crime. A portion of sec. 1 of the Regulation XVII of 1829 passed by the Governor-General Lord William Bentinck is set out below. We are now in &amp; position to take a dispassionate view of the practice, to trace its origin and follow its working down to the date of its being declared illegal. It is not possible in the space available here to go into all details. Those interested may read the latest book on the subject by Mr. Edward Thomson.&quot; The burning</p>
<p>1461, Suttee&rsquo; (1928), which gives an account of it from the most ancient times, of the efforts made to suppress it by Raja Rama Mohan Roy and the British Government. In an appendix the autbor gives extracts from the accounts reported by those who witnessed widow burning from 317 B. C. to 1845 A, D. Vide also Max Muller&rsquo;s H. A. S. L. p. 48 for references to the custom of widow-burning among Greeks and Soythians; Die Frau&rsquo; pp. 74-79 for accounts of travellers and eye witueg808; Colebrooke&rsquo;s Miscellaneous Essay&amp; vol. I (ed. of 1837) pp. 114-116 (for description of the rite), vol. II. chap. III. Pp. 153-158; Annals of the Bhandarkar 0. R. Institute vol. 14, p. 219. In the Travels of Poter Mundy (1608-1669) published by the Hakluyt Society in 1914 vol. II, pp. 34-36, the author gives an account of the burning of a widow at Surat in 1630 with a sketch showing the widow having on her lap the hoad of her deceased husband. That writer also notes that the practice had in his time become rare, as under the Mogal rulers a special license from tho Ruler or Governor was required. Similarly Barbosa (a Portugueso ) describes the burning of a sati in the Vijayanagar kingdom (vide translation by M. L. Dames, vol. I. pp. 213-216 ).</p>
<p>Seotion 1 of Regulation XVII of 1829 whioh doclared the practice of san illegal and a crime punishable in the courts (and passed by the Governor-General in Council on 4th December 1829 ) is, Tbe practice of Suttee or of burning or burying alive the widows of Hindoos is revolt ing to the foelings of human nature ; it is nowhere enjoined by the religion of the Hindoos as an imporative duty ; on the contrary life of</p>

<p>of widows was not peculiar to Brahmanism, as many are prone to believe, but the custom owes its origin to the oldest religious views and superstitious practices of mankind in general. The practice of widow burning obtained among ancient Greeks, Germans, Slavs and other races (vide &lsquo;Die Frau&rsquo; pp. 56, 82-83 and Sobrader&rsquo;s &lsquo;Prehistoric Antiquities of the Aryan People,&rsquo; English Translation of 1890, p. 391 and Wester marok&rsquo;s Origin and Development of Moral Ideas&rsquo;, 1906, vol. I, pp. 472–476 ), but was generally confined to the great ones, the princes and nobles.</p>
<p>There is no Vedic passage which can be cited as incon trovertibly referring to widow-burning as then current, nor is there any mantra which could be said to have been repeated in very ancient times 1468 at such burning nor do the ancient gphy &amp; sūtras contain any direction prescribing the procedure of widow burning. It therefore appears probable that the practice arose in Brahmanical India &amp; few centuries before Christ. Whether it was indigenous or was copied from some non-Aryan or non Indian tribes cannot be demonstrated. None of the dharmasūtras</p>
<p>(Continued from last page) purity and retirement on the part of the widow is more especially and preferably inculcated and by a vast majority of that peoplo throughout India the practice is not kept up or observed ; in some extensive districts it does not exist; in those in which it has been most froquent, it is notorious that, in many instances, acts of atrocity bayo been perpetrated, which have been shocking to the Hindoos thomselves, and in their eyes unlawful and wicked&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; Actuated by those considerations the Governor-General in Council, without intending to dopart from one of the first and most important principles of the system of British Govorament in India that all classes of the people be secure in the observance of their religious usages, 80 long as that Bystem can be adhered to without violation of the paramount dictates of justice and humanity, has deemed it right to establish the following rules &amp;o,</p>

<p>except Viṣṇu contains any reference to sati. The Manusmrti is entirely silent about it. It is stated in Strabo (XV. 1. 30 and 62 ) that the Greeks under Alexander found sati practised among the Cathaei in the Punjab and that that practice arose from the apprehension that wives would desert or poison their husbands (Hamilton and Falooner&rsquo;s Translation vol. III ). The Viṣṇu-dharmasūtra 1183 says &lsquo;On her husband&rsquo;s death the widow should observe celibaoy or should ascend the funeral pyre after him.&rsquo; The Mahābhārata, though it is profuse in the descriptions of sanguinary fights, is very sparing in its references to widow burning. Mādrl, the favourite wife of Pāṇdu, burnt herself with her husband&rsquo;s body. 1464 In the Virāṭa-parva Sairandhri is ordered to be burnt with Kicaka, 1465 just as in ancient times it is said there was a custom to bury a slave or slaves along with the deceased ruler. The Mausala parva ( 7.18 ) says that four wives of Vasudeva, viz. Devaki, Bhadra, Rohiniand Madirā burnt themselves with him and (cbap. 7.73-74) that Rukmiṇi, Gāndhāri, Saibyā, Haimavati, Jāmbavati among the consorts of Krṣṇa burnt themselves along with his body and other queens like Satyabhāmā went to &amp; forest for tapas. The Viṣṇupurāṇa also says that eight queens of Krona, Rukmiṇi and others, entered fire on the death of Krsna.1468 The Sāntiparva (chap. 148 ) describes how a kapoti (female pigeon) entered fire on the death of her husband the bird. 1467 In the Striparva (chap. 26 ) the Great Epio describes the death cere monies performed for the fallen Kauravas, but no mention is made of any widow immolating herself on the funeral pyre though the chariots, clothes and weapons of the warriors are said to have been consigned to fire. From the above it appears</p>

<p>that the practice was originally confined to royal families and great warriors even in India and that cases of widow burning were rare. Several texts are cited by Aparārka from Paighinasi, Angiras, Vyāghrapād which apparently forbid self-immolation to brābmana widows. 1488 The authors of digests explain away these passages by saying that they only probibit self-immola tion by a brāhmaṇa widow on a funeral pyre different from that of the husband i. e. a brāhmaṇa widow can burn herself only on the funeral pyre of her husband and if his body is cremated elsewhere in a foreign land, his widow cannot, on hearing of his death, burn herself later. They rely on the text of Usadas that a brāhmaṇa widow should not follow her husband on &amp; separate funeral pyre. The Veda-Vyāsa-smṛti ( 11.53 ) says that &amp; brāhmaṇa wife should enter fire, clasping the dead body of her husband; if sbe lives ( after her husband ) she should give up adorning her hair and emaciate her body by austerities.1469 In the Rāmāyaṇa, 1470 ( Uttarakāṇda 17. 15 ) there is a reference to the self-immolation of &amp; brāhmaṇa woman ( the wife of &amp; brahmarṣi and mother of Vedavati, who when molested by Ravana burnt herself in fire). The Mahābharata (Stri parva 23. 34 ff.) on the other hand describes how Krpi, the wife of Droṇa, the brahmana commander-in-chief of the Kauravas, appeared with dishevelled hair on the battle-field on the death of her husband, but does not say that she burnt herself.171 It appears therefore that the burning of brāhmana widows began much later than that of kṣatriya widows.</p>

In the Kumārasambhava (IV. 34 ) of Kālidāsa, Rati, the wife of Kama who was burnt by Śiva, speaks of throwing herself into fire, but is held baok by &amp; heavenly voice. In the Gātbāsaptasati ( VII. 33 ) there is a reference to a woman being decked for anumarana (Nirṇ, ed.). The Kāmasūtra VI. 3.53 speaks of anumarana. It has been shown (at p.579) how Varāha mihira admires women for their courage in being burnt with their husbands. The Harṣacarita ( Ucchvāsa 5 ) describes how Yagomati, the chief queen of king Prabhākaravardhana and mother of Harṣa, consigned herself to fire when the king was dying. But this is not a proper case of sati, as she burnt herself even before her husband died. In another passage of the Harsacarita (V, in the description of night) the glory of moon-lotuses is said to be laughing like a woman intent on anumarapa, who is decked with ear ornaments and wears garlands on her head.1473 Bana in his Kadambari in a most eloquent and well-reasoned passage condemns anumarapa.&quot;*** The Bhāgavatapurāṇa 1475 I. 13, 57 speaks of Gandhārl&rsquo;s burning herself on the death of her husband, Dhftarāṣtra.

<p>629</p>
<p>Rajatarangiṇi cites in several places (e. g. VI. 107, 195; VII. 103, 478 ) examples of sati.</p>
<p>In numerous epigraphic records reference is made to the practice of sati. Among the earliest is the one in 191 of the Gupta era (510 A. D.) in the Gupta Inscriptions ( ed. by Fleet) p. 91. Vide also the Eran posthumous stone pillar Insoription of Goparāja which says that his wife accompanied him on the funeral pyre when he was killed in battle; I. A. vol. IX. p. 164 ( Nepal Inscription of 705 A. D., where Rajyavati, widow of Dharmadeva, bids her son Mabādeva to take up the reins of government that she may follow her husband); the Belaturu Inscription of saka 979 of the time of Rajendradeva Cola ( E. I. vol. VI, p. 213 ) where &amp; śūdra woman Dekabbe, on hearing of her husband&rsquo;s death, burnt herself in spite of the strong opposition of her parents who then erected &amp; stone monument to her; E. I. vol. 14 p. 265, 267 where a grant is made in saka 1103 to a temple by Sinda Mahāmandalesvara Rācamalla on &amp; request by two satis, widows of his general Becirāja ; E. I. vol. 20, p. 168 ( of Cedi samvat 919 ) which refers to three queens that became satis; E. I. vol X, p. 39 where the Temara &ldquo;gate stone inscription of saka 1246 speaks of Māṇikyadevi as sati on the death of her husband Amana who was an officer of king Hariscandra; E. I. vol. 20 p. 58 ( Mistra Deoli Inscription</p>
<p>in Jodbpur when two queens of a Gohila Rāṇā became satis); E. I. vol. 16, p. 10, n. 4 and p. 11, n. 2 for sati records of saka 1365 and 1362. In an article on Sati memorial stones&rsquo; in J. B. O. R. S. vol. 23, p. 435 ff. it is shown how the memorial stones usually bear the figure of the upraised arm and of the sun and the moon on either side and a group of stars. Among the well-known latest historical examples of sati is that of Ramabai, wife of the Peshwa Madhavrao I, in 1772 A. D. The Jauhar practised by the Rajput ladies of Chitor and other places for saving themselves from unspeakable atrocities at the hands of the victorious Moslems are too well-known to need any lengthy notice.</p>
<p>In the Indian Antiquary vol. 35 p. 129 there is a paper on Sati immolation which is not sati&rsquo;, where several examples of men who killed themselves out of devotion to their pasters or for other causes are cited and it is pointed out how stone monuments ( called māstikkal i. e. stone monument for mahāsati a great sati, and&rsquo; virakkal&rsquo; for brave and devoted mon) are erected</p>

<p>in memory of satis and men. The Harṣacarita (V. 3rd para from end) describes how many of the king&rsquo;s friends, ministers, servants and favourites killed themselves on the death of Prabhākaravar dbana. The Rājatarangiṇi VII. 481 narrates how when the queen of king Ananta became a sati on her husband&rsquo;s death, her litter carrier and some other men and three of her dāsis followed her in death. There is the example of a mother burning herself on the funeral pyre of her son (vide Rājstarangini VII. 1380). We shall see later on that suioide at holy places like Prayage was practised for attaining heavenly worlds and bliss. Life seems to have been deemed of small account in those ages and though the death of women or men on the funeral pyre of the husband or for their masters appears to us sophisticated people of modern days as very horrible, it did not so appear to the ancients. Sati was not in historic times a practice imposed by priests or men on unwilling women. It somehow grew and it is improper to say that men imposed it on women. It may be that examples of sati ocourred because of the force of popular sentiment. It was first confined to kings and nobles, because the lot of the wives of conquered kings and warriors was most miserable in all countries as well as in India. Vengeance for the truculence of their husbands was wreaked on the poor wives by carrying them as captives and making them work as slaves. Manu (VII. 96 ) allows a soldier to retain women (probably &lsquo;slaves&rsquo;) conquered by him along with other booty. When queen Yasomati narrates to her son Harsa the great honour and glory that was hers during the reign of her husband king Prabhākaravardhana, she refers to the fact that the wives of the enemies defeated by her husband waved chowries over her. 1476 From kings the practice spread among brāhmaṇas, though as shown above, several smṛtikāras disapproved of the practice among brāhmaṇa wives. Once it took root learned commentators and digest writers were found to support it with arguments and promises of future rewards. Even in modern times we can secure learned writers to support any pet theory of a coterie or olique. When Manchester and Liverpool were prosperous, English economists preached the doctrine of free trade and laissez faire to all nations, but in more difficult times we bave now the apotheosis of Empire Preference and discriminating preference for home-made goods. Manu IV. 178 asks people to do whatever their forefathers did.</p>

<p>The rewards promised to a sati were as follows: Saṅkba and Angiras 1477 say &lsquo;she who follows her husband in death dwells in heaven for as many years as there are hair on the human body, viz. 33 crores of years. Just as &amp; snake-catcher draws out a snake from a hole by force, 80 such a woman draws her husband from ( wherever he may be ) and enjoys bliss together with him. In heaven she being solely devoted to her husband and praised by bevies of heavenly damsels sports with her husband for as long as fourteen Indras rule. Even if the husband be guilty of the murder of a brāhmaṇa or of a friend or be guilty of ingratitude, the wife who dies (in fire ) clasping his body, purifies him ( of the sin). That woman, who asconds (the funeral pyre) when the husband dies, is equal to Arundhati in her character and is praised in heaven. As long as a woman does not burn herself in fire on the death of her hus band she is never free from being born as a woman (in succes sive birtbs)&rsquo;. Hārita says that woman who follows her husband in death purifies three families, viz. of her mother, of her father and of her husband&rsquo;. The Mit. after quoting the above passages adds that this duty of anvārohana is common to the women of all castes from the brāhmaṇa to the cāṇdāla, provided they are not pregnant or they have no young children ( at the husband&rsquo;s death ) 1478</p>

<p>way of blaok magic to kill his enemy. He says 147that though Angiras allowed &lsquo;anumarana&rsquo; it is suicide and is really forbidden to women. Just as the Veda says &lsquo;syenenabbicaran yajet&rsquo; and yet syenayaga is not looked upon as dharma, but rather as adharma ( vide Sabara on Jaimini I. 1. %), so, though Angiras speaks of it, it is really adharma; and that a woman who is in a hurry and extremely anxious to secure heaven quickly for herself and her husband might act according to Angiras, still her action is aśāstriya ( not in accordance with the sāstras ); besides apvārohana is opposed to the Vedic text &lsquo;ope should not leave this world before one has finished one&rsquo;s allotted span of life.&rdquo; The Mit. on Yāj. I. 86 coinbats these arguments. It says that śyenayāga is no doubt undesirable and therefore adharma, but that is so because the object of syenayāga is injury to another. Anugamana on the other hand is not so; there the result promised is heaven which is &amp; desir. able result and which is enjoined by fruti in such sentenoes as * one should sacrifice a wbite goat to Vāyu if one desires pros perity&rsquo;. Similarly the smrti about anugamana is not opposed to the fruti quoted, the meaning of which is different; that sruti means &lsquo;one should not waste one&rsquo;s life for securing heavenly bliss which is fleeting and insignificant as compared with the supreme bliss of Brahma knowledge. As the woman in anumarana desires only heaven, she is not doing anything cont rary to the sruti texts. This is the reasoning of the Mitakṣarā which looks like special pleading. Aparārka p. 111, the Madang. pārijāta p. 199, Par. M. II. part I pp. 55-56 follow the reasoning of the Mit. and add that the Vedic text about the allotted span of life is a general rule, while the smrti about anumarana is a special or exceptional sastra and so there is no contradiction as the rule applies to all cases outside the excepted one. The Madanapērijāta (p. 200 ) further explains that the texts about purifying a husband guilty of brābmaṇa murder are not to be taken literally but only as byperbolically extolling anvārohana.</p>

<p>The Sm. O. also expressly says that anvārohana, 1480 though re commended by the Viṣṇu Dh. 8. (25. 14) and Angiras, is inferior to brabmacarya (leading a celibate life ), since the rewards of anvārohana sre inferior to those of brahmacary8. As against this may be cited the extreme view of Angiras &lsquo;for all women there is no other duty except falling into the funeral pyre, when the husband dies.&ldquo;148The Suddhitattva remarks that this extreme or sweeping statement is made by way of belauding sahamarana.</p>
<p>We saw above that brāhmaṇa widows were only allowed anvārohana, but not anumaraṇa. There were other restrictions enjoined by the smrtis on all widows&rsquo; wives who have &amp; child of tender years, who are pregnant, who have not attained puberty and who are in their monthly course do not mount the funeral pyre of their husbands&rsquo; 1488&mdash;from the Bṛban-Naradiya puriṇa. There is a similar verse of Bphaspati. The wife who was in her course was allowed to burn berself after she batbed on the fourth day.</p>
<p>Apagtamba ( verse ) prescribes the Prājāpatys penance for a woman who having first resolved to burn herself on the funeral pyre turns back from it at the last moment. 1483 The Rajatarangini (VI. 196 ) refers to a queen who having pretended to have resolved on becoming sati ultimately regretted the step and turned back.</p>
<p>The Suddhitattva sets out the procedure of widow burning. 1484 The widow bathes and puts on two white garments, takes kuśa blades in her hands, faces the east or north, performs koamana (sip ping water); when the brāhmaṇas say &lsquo;om, tat sat&rsquo; she remembers the God Narayana and refers to the time (month, fortnight,</p>

<p>tithi) and then makes the saṅkalpa ( declaration of resolve ) set out below. She then calls upon the eight lokapalas (guardians of the quarters ), tbe sun, the moon, the fire &amp;c. to become witnesses to her act of following her husband on the funeral pyre, she then goes round the fire thrice, then the brahmana recites the Vedic verse &lsquo;imā nārir &amp;c.&rsquo; (Rg. X. 18. 7) and &amp; Purāṇa verse &lsquo;may these very good and holy women who are devoted to their husbands enter fire together with the body of the husband,&rsquo; the woman utters &rsquo;namo namah&rsquo; and ascends the kindled pyre. The long-winded preamble of the bamkalpa *arundhati&hellip; patipūtatvakāmā&rsquo; is based upon the verses of Angiras quoted above (in n. 1477). Toe Suddhitattva as printed is corrupt but it appears that it read the last quarter of Rg. X. 18. 7 A8 *Orobantu jalayonim-8gne&rsquo; ( let them ascend the watery seat or origin, O fire 1) meaning probably may fire be to them as cool as water&rsquo;. Some writers have charged the brahmana priest-hood (or Raghunandana ) with having purposely changed the reading of the verge Rg. X18. 7 in order to make it suit the rite of immolating oneself in fire (i. e. agne&rsquo; or &lsquo;agneh&rsquo; was substituted for agre). But this charge is not sustainable. That the verge Rg. X. 18. 7 as it actually is was held to refer to widow burning centuries before Raghunandana follows from the fact that even the Brahmapurāṇa 1485 and Aparārka ( quoted above on p. 628 ) take it in that sense. It was therefore not necessary to alter the reading. Furthor even if some priests or Raghunandana had changed it that fact would have been detected in no time, as in those days there were thousands of people who know every syllable of the Rgveda by heart. There fore it must be admitted that either the M89. are corrupt or Raghu nandana committed an inpocent slip. Tbat mantra was not addressed to widows at all, but to ladies of the deceased man&rsquo;s household whose husbands were living and the gļhyasūtra of Asy, made use of it with that meaning. Raghunandana, a profound student of dharmasastras and smrtis (and often styled Smārta-bhattācārya), could not have been ignorant of what Āśv. Baid.

<p>It appears from all accounts of travellers and others that widow-burning prevailed more in Bengal during the centuries immediately preceding its abolition than anywhere else in India. 1487 If that was so, there were certain good reasons for that state of things. In the whole of India, except Bengal, the widows of members in a joint Hindu family are only entitled to maintenance and have no other rights over the property of the family. In Bengal, wherever the Dāyabbāga prevails, the widow of a sonless member even in a joint Hindu family is entitled to practically the same rights over joint family property which her deceased husband would have had. This must have frequently induced the surviving 1488 members to get rid of the widow by appealing at a most distressing hour to her devotion to and love for her husband. This rule of the widow&rsquo;s right was not for the first time propounded by Jimūta vāhana ; he makes it clear that he followed a predecessor called Jiten driya. The figures given above lend support to the view expressed here, since Benares, where the rights of widows were insignificant, was responsible for a small number of satis only. It is impossible, however, to believe that the number of widows in ordinary stations of life burning themselves was very large at any time or that most of the widows that did so were coerced into doing it. There is a good deal of epigraphic and other evidence particularly in otber parts of India that rela tives tried to dissuade the widow from taking the step. Even in Bengal the number of salis must never have been very</p>

<p>Thomson in bis book on &lsquo;Suttes&rsquo; (pp. 69,72) gives the figures for satis reported from the Bengal Presidency (which then included Bibur and extended up to Bepares) during 1815-1828. The lowest figure was 378 in 1815 and tbe highest 839 in 1818. Out of the total of 2366 cases during the four years 1815-1818, tbe Calcutta division alone contributed 1485, the Benares division, the rest of orthodoxy, contri buted only 343. Vide H, H. Wilson&rsquo;s History of India&rsquo; (ed, of 1858), vol. III (for 1805-1836 A. D.), PP 185-192. At p. 189 &amp; table of the number of satis for 1815-1828 is given, from which it appears that in 1828 there were 463 cases of satis ont of whom 420 came from Boogal, Bihar and Orissa, out of which 287 were from the Caloutta divisioo slono.</p>

<p>large. Colebrooke, who had spent the best part of his life in Bengal and who was a profound Sanskrit scholar, observes in a paper written about 1795 A. D. &lsquo;Happily the martyrs of this superstition bave never been numerous. It is certain that the instances of the widow&rsquo;s sacrifices are now rare &lsquo;.1489 The very fact that there was no disturbance of peace or ebullition of popular feeling or even any great verbal protest from the vast Hindu population (except a petition to the Privy Council) against Bentinck&rsquo;s sweeping measure indioates two things, viz. that the burning of widows was a rare occurrence and that people were not very keen on observing the practice nor bad they any very deep-seated convictions about its absolute religious necessity. 1480</p>
<p>Modern India does not justify the practice of sati, but it is &amp; warped mentality that rebukes modern Indians for expressing sdrairation and reverence for the cool and unfaltering courage of Indian women in becoming satīs or performing the jauhar for cherishing their ideals of womanly conduct. If Englishmen can feel pride in their ancestors who grabbed one fourth of the world&rsquo;s surface or if Frenchmen can feel pride in the deeds of their Emperor Napoleon who tried to enslave the whole of Europe and yet are not held up to ridicule or rebuke, there is no reason why poor Indians cannot express admiration for the sacrifices which their women made in the past, though they may condemn the institution itself which demanded such terrible sacrifice and suffering.</p>
